From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and HalJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. Wegot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTimedoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was statedabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large sizethen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit).

Space ScienceDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sailproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen togenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out atthe meeting. Here goes : 			The Microlight Solar Sail			-------------------------1. IntroductionThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure ofsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such avehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than mostpeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram persquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminizedfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' typespacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hteidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.2.DesignRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: atiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purelybe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude controlmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on apanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed atEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and datagathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control andcommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surfaceof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost ofthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.3.MissionsThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amorgroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bitrate.b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobservedareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail toreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receivesunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm thatvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in theselocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunarbase, BTW]c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or cometnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craftcauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edgedtube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as anideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heatis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulatingcontainer.Contact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England--------------------------------This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project orseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you moreinformation.

From: baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke)Subject: SIRTF Mission is Still AliveOrganization: Jet Propulsion LaboratoryLines: 114Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.govKeywords: SIRTF, JPLNews-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    From the "JPL Universe"April 23, 1993SIRTF is still very much in businessBy Mark Whalen     In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets, the verysurvival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanksto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL'sSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major projectconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "aliveand well," according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission haveadded up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientificpower" and a bright future, said Werner.     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful InfraredAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory forinfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.     IRAS' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as neverbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25comets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive thanany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE hasmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on largeangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.     But to illuminate SIRTF's potential, Jim Evans, JPL'smanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,recently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times morecapable than IRAS," based on technological advances in infrareddetector arrays.     However, despite the enormous strides in infraredexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as thehighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a "diet or die"directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the projectgoing, according to Werner.     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the keyfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the suninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocketlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. "Themain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of yourlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have tocarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," Werner said.The other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it's in abetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."     Additional major changes in SIRTF's redesign includeshortening the mission from five to three years and building aspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the originalplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)compared to Titan SIRTF's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).     All of that adds up to "a less stressful launchenvironment," Werner said, and a cost savings of more than 200million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in thedesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.     Werner said SIRTF's redesign came as a result of Congress'telling NASA "you're trying to do too many things. If you want usto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to seehow it fits into (NASA's) overall strategy."     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA's highestpriority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinarySpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessingfrom the National Academy of Sciences.     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descopingto keep the project alive, SIRTF's major scientific contributionalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detectorarrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens ofthousands of times faster" than before, according to Evans.     "Up until a couple of years ago," Werner said, "all infraredastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arraysof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Departmentof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens orhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, andthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF."     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budgetpressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with aneye out for any "technological spinoff."     "On that question, I think we have some things to say," hesaid, "because the detectors we're using are straight off variousmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineeringchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.     "SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"Werner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premiumon observing time. We have to educate the user community anddevelop a program that involves early surveys and quickturnaround of the data."     Werner said the downsizing of the project required areduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF's three instruments --the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multibandimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result inlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.     The project hopes to start a "Phase B" activity in 1995,which will provide a detailed concept for development and design.Building the hardware would begin about two years later.     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are 850 million-950million.     "I am very optimistic about SIRTF," he said. "It willprovide a tremendous return for the investment."     Werner added that an additional benefit from the projectwill be the "enrichment of our intellectual and culturalenvironment. People on the street are very interested inastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on otherplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind ofquestions SIRTF will help answer."                                   ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

From: gamesmax.u.washington.eduSubject: SSTO Senatorial (aide) breifing recollections.Article-I.D.: max.1993Apr6.125512.1Distribution: worldLines: 78NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.eduThe following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lillyhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) PattyMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were notbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporatealigned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't knowthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very interested in, although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.

Forproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage RocketTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How tolower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry forour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of atorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a newthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old thingsfrom past masters.     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so calledexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made nosense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president ofthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space." Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad  What are theseprinciples that SSRT defies?     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you needa giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the"fact" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And itviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant forless than many billions of dollars.     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach ussome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not aSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years todemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost 1 billion.     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remindus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was asenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of asingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build alittle, Test a little.     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  Wedidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just changeevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- TheALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would betterknown as "Shape Shifter" than "Space Lifter."  We didn't spend alot money -- this X-Rocket only cost 60 million.  When's thelast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn'ttake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted ofone very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by thethreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair ifit ran over cost or schedule.     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind itsonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and stepsthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  Buteach step should follow the same principles -- a small managementteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modestbudget.     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:(See charts)     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the lastgeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950'sand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope thatcan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least wecould do is soft-land on Earth     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build alittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordableand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers amongyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermalprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to landhorizontally, etc, etc.     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  Youbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we dowhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ notincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have yourprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, anddecade long programs.]     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea -- Any Takers?

For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The "Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual," ASC G&C 2102,    says:	"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target	in second stage."    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try    to interpret.    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the	"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly	negative angle ("a negative q-alpha").	This causes a little bit of	"downward" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z	direction) and this force "alleviates structural loading."	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the	most "delicate" part of the vehicle.    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be	the case if we didn't roll ("performance gain").    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site ("decreased abort maneuver	complexity").    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio	antennae on the Orbiter ("improved S-band look angles").    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, "Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the "top"    [Orbiter side] and the "bottom" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the "roll    maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news.

From: Wales.Larrisonofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 81Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of theCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is verycommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on thespace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the(very prominent) logos on its side of   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and   - the GPS/Navstar program office   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that onlyorganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on theside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, puttinga 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the camerasis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in myopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle hasrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentialsfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing largeadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know ofseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked atputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payloadbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", inthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firmsparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums forthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (Forexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting aDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameraswould scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowedto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoecompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the lastOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items fromparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, forexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of theBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launchvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMETrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisementson the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The LastAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participatingorganizations, Columbia pictures has paid 500,000 to put ads on themain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its boosterrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth forone month.  A concept for this advertising display was published inSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, istalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea hecreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertisingsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for thespace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space onthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not usehis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA andreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launchis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of theadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program iscoming from NASA.)  ORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction forsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and RobertHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Severaldifferent potential projects have been developed, although none havebeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "EiffelII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture inorbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

Mycomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendorsthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe thatwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of theCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at aprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be aroundfor a while, rather than being flushed.Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has tokeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myselfpressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the booksjust before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired ofgetting boned in the process.Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so wearen't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labsand organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computersevery year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through theentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  Thatmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when Ihave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase oneprevious poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some othervendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how Icould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we'resupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in acorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.							spl-- Steve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- splszechuan.ucsd.eduSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608"My other car is a car, too."                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video captureusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spotquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one(1.5).   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quitenicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that itwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then heincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't knowwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktimecould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was havinga little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk  This wasfrom memory   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or somehardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I canclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumerlow-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, no longer CD-I.--------------------------------------Raist  New A1200 owner   320<->1280 in x, 200<->600 in yin 256,000+ colors from a 24-bit palette.  **I LOVE IT**<- New Low Fat .sig*don't e-mail me* -> I don't have a valid address nor can I send e-mail

For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specificimpulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dryweight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand orbirdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would bethe payload.  I am sure the whole project is well withinthe capability of the amateur rocketry community.It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reductionof Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussedhere: 1 billion for the first person to spend 1 yearon the moon, 1 million for the first erradication ofan orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge 1000for the first person to bring it down, and I am surethere are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the useof a large caliber gun; or the solution which was appliedto Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)-- 		David M.

From: bolsoncarson.u.washington.edu (Edward Bolson)Subject: Re: Sphere from 4 points?Organization: University of Washington, SeattleLines: 33Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.eduI plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have workingcode, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes methodlooks best, but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favorof dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In eithercase a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solutionof linear equations).To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the "normalized" vector from P1 to P2.These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resultingcenter point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks likeI need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, whichwill require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy tofind).Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 setsof 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also definethe circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make thelines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a uniquepoint if they are not parallel.EdThanks to all who answered so far.-- Ed BolsonUniversity of Washington  Cardiovascular Research               (206)543-4535bolsonu.washington.edu (preferred)bolsonmax.bitnet                bolsonmilton.u.washington.edu (if you must)

But here's a brief summary...PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to manydevices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and takeadvantage of a 3D extension to X called "PEX".  PEXlib is a slightly"lower" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEXextension to X.Some advantages of using PEXlib...- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS- Provides immediate mode capabilities- Is free of "policy"- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.Some advantages of using PHIGS...- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things likearchiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find thatboth API's have a lot in common.Ralph MorMIT X Consortium

Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD

Wewould like a system, based either on VHS or 8mm video which will allow one write video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time.  It's forvisualization of physics problems.  Can anyone tell me what hardware isavailable which would work for our system?  Some support software isobviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since thesoftware we actually use for the visualization is all already written.Please email with replies, as I don't read this group.  Many thanks for yourhelp.Dr. M. E. J. Newman.Department of Physics,Cornell University.newmmehelios.tn.cornell.edu

A few years ago beforeI knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of theApple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quitelimited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still hasto plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothingon GL, for example, where you can handle objects.Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,but I'd assume there's better software available that gives betteroutput and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier toprogram).Just my 2% tax-Brent

Like fuelfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if thecontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't beworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapestheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If Idon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great, I'll use it.But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about alow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A GeneralDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upperstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering twounmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was 10-13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was 6-9billion for the US share.I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet thatits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metrictonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crewhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes forthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* beable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoorseats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (orcollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's roundthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 tonpayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, twoLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for ayear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way ofdelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyonehave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables andequipment would weigh?And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discardedto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for theDC-1.All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on themoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the firstnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a mannedmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables fromlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Findsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goalmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appearedto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scaryabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'dlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was anEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases onthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the humanbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solarflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

From: zyehcaspian.usc.edu (zhenghao yeh)Subject: Ellipse AgainOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CALines: 39Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: caspian.usc.eduKeywords: ellipseHi Everyone,Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guessmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle whichrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipseand its offset is same everywhere.This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs thepositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse stillan ellipse? The answer is no Ironically, DMIS - an American IndutrialStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which wasimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also soldinternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bugHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And mostimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last yearto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of thisproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entireor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse froma quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is notanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make thingscomplicated. Please give me a hint.I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.However, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?Please post here and let the others share our interests (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need thesummary of the answers).YehUSC

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing>  program.I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines andpolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number ofpoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, theJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane intoexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line liescompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.Now, the phrasing of this question says "if a line intersects a polygon", sothis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) isto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try tosolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in anew language called PostScript.  (See "PostScript Language", by Adobe SystemsIncorporated, ISBN  0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program thatdraws the line L and the polygon P, and then "outputs" the answer.  By"output", we mean the program executes a command called "showpage", whichactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quickexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thusthe original problem.There are two small problems with this approach. 	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in	other words, will it halt?	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn	out to be undecidable.I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finiteprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.A couple of references might be:1.

By the well knownDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced toHamiltonian Circuit, without() the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin anacronym) is probably only NP-complete.

From: jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)Subject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint ventureOrganization: University of Illinois at UrbanaLines: 121I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at aninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament andInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because thecompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped thathis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tongato visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about 70 million,His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thoughtthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronoussatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot ofslots.The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and CarlHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinionssupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in theworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a taxhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, tofill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would havecost approximately 2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the waythat people operate.  For example "everybody can sell you everything."  Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are theonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a costof 150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternbergsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos wasout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  Heagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessionsbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has builtabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented thatsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honestpeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At thispoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion onboth siberians and midwesterners :-)Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about 4 million to build a satellite thatwould sell for 50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellitesthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about 378,000 per transponder year.  Thiscompares to 810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about 1.1million compared to 2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can giveyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they aregetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into placenow.Tidbits:*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not bigbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, exceptthat "we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier."*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launchwithin 9 months.*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirementfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says issort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worriedpartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvaryingmonolith.  Italy gets a new government "every two weeks" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing whatreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transferingmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the "equivalent" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrianbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so thatthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same typeof satellites, which was rather reassuring.*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitivetechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites havea lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites comparewell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newertechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of datehardware.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    "Find a way or make one."	             -attributed to Hannibal

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaurdoes. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........|> |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course|> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the|> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big , not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea. -- H.D.

We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured theprinter with the "lp" system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image formatand translating the image into postscript.We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is 5000 and does not come with a warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work.Here my questions:If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is thelimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer? The Big question:Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis.

From: mcelwrecnsvax.uwec.eduSubject: LARSONIAN Astronomy and PhysicsOrganization: University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines: 552                      LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists           CLAIM to be looking for a "Unified Field Theory" in which all           of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single           set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically           IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years                The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he           calls the "Reciprocal System", is built on two fundamental           postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of           space and time:                    (1) "The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."                    (2) "The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."                    From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE           Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of           translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward           SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light           (which Larson called "UNIT VELOCITY" and "THE NATURAL           DATUM").                      At each step in the development, Larson was able to           MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the           REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles           [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star           clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white           dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET           DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY           BURSTS).                          And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,           Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility           and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of           matter.                All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy           complex mathematics, in his books.               BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                         The following is a complete list of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL           UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and           should be available via inter-library loan if your local           university or public library doesn't have each of them.                Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available           from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS),           1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the           organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.            They have other related publications, including the quarterly           journal "RECIPROCITY".                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background                   Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer           (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he           died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in           Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He           developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE           chemical properties based only on the elements used.                    Larson's lack of a fancy "PH.D." degree might be one           reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is           NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider           to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same           time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX           physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,           well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC           ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                     Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally           test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.            He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER           researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in           many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                    A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX           physicists and astronomers have  They CLAIM to be looking           for a "unified field theory" that works, but have been           IGNORING one for over 30 years now                    "Modern physics" does NOT explain the physical universe           so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of           quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who           agree.  And remember that "epicycles", "crystal spheres",           "geocentricity", "flat earth theory", etc., ALSO once SEEMED           to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                        Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,           was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or           still is) President of Larson's organization, "THE           INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE", and Editor of           their quarterly Journal "RECIPROCITY".  He moved to           Minneapolis after retiring.               "Super Collider" BOONDOGGLE                         I am AGAINST contruction of the "Superconducting Super           Collider", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS           WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of "scientific"           value.                    Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the           comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist           Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY           particles ("mesons", "hyperons", ALLEGED "quarks", etc.)           which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,           Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are           CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly           disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible           with their environment.                    A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a           few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not           seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE           CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW                    Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the 8.3           BILLION cost?  Don't we have much more important uses for           this WASTED money?                         Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed           location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some           kind of "fire ants" eating the insulation off underground           cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water           with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of           the "Supercollider"?                              Naming the "Super Collider" after Ronald Reagon, as           proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD  If it is built, it should be           named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                 LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                         In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of           opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more           to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the           photons of which they are made, in relation to the           vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,           which Larson calls "Unit Velocity" and the "Natural Datum".                     In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,           the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their           respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each           other.                      In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical           universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension           of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our           MATERIAL half.                  LARSONIAN Relativity                         The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury           has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the           rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this           advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational           perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,           etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to           help "prove" Einstein's "General Theory of Relativity".                    But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results           CLOSER to the 43 seconds than "General Relativity" can, by           INSTEAD using "SPECIAL Relativity".  In one or more of his           books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH           ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                    Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of "Special           Relativity", including the parts about "mass increases" near           the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on           doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than           1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,           although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                     In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the           physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead           of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured           from our material half of the physical universe.  The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low           relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are           NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and           the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.           [Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing           about this.]                         In regard to "mass increases", it has been PROVEN in           atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near           the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory,           mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is           actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS           BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.            The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward           SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of           the so-called "Big Bang" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL           FANTASY).

It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL           looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with           OPEN MINDS                    The following is an example of his Theory's success:           In his first book in 1959, "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL           UNIVERSE", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING           GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding           them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's           comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he           had an immediate related explanation for them also.                GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching           their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were           originally thought to originate from "neutron stars" in the           disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in           Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions           uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT           correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of           directional coincidence).                    Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of           his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", published in 1984, the           gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the           ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls           the "Cosmic Sector".  Because of the relationship between the           anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and           the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can           pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at           random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do           not correspond with known objects, and come from all           directions uniformly.)                    I wonder how close to us in space a source location           would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most           life on Earth  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it                    Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which           are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were           actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS               LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                         About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the           vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox           astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory           theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                    But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY           CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of           the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey           B. Larson.                    I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is           detailed in Chapter 7 of his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"           and in some of his other books.                    First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by "fusion".  A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE           ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each           element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the           element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal           temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and           absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually           reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and           lighter elements.                    When the internal temperature of the star reaches the           destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I           SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION  This is because there is SO MUCH iron           present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms           and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some           of his books [better than I can].                    When the star explodes, the lighter material on the           outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less           than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center           portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to           the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The           explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and           it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN           SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                    Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall           back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown           outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The           material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a           WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward           the "MAIN SEQUENCE" from opposite directions on the H-R           Diagram.                    The chances of the two masses falling back into the           exact same location in space, making a single lone star           again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY           system, orbiting each other.                     According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE           DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the           material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown           outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about "degenerate matter", "neutron           stars", "black holes", etc..               LARSONIAN Solar System Formation               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the           exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single           white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL "mini" white dwarf           stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably           still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected           by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS                      In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all           this information, and other principles of his comprehensive           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive           his own version of Bode's Law.                     "Black Hole" FANTASY               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently           completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO "black           holes" merging together into a SINGLE "black hole", and           concluded that the new "black hole" would have MORE MASS than           the sum of the two original "black holes".                    Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED           FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of "black           holes", etc.                    After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about           his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe, especially his book "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", it is           clear to me that "black holes" are NOTHING more than           MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is           just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the "black           hole" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want           to "prove" their theory.                        By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is           being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and           astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical           problem somehow makes him "wiser".  It does NOT                    I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist           Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread           publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's           Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of           Unified Science).                                         ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection           with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to           find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                    I found a possible clue about why they might work on           pages 112-113 of the book "BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER", by           the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of           Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe.  I quote one paragraph:                    "As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development           of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally           different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.            The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It           was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book "NOTHING BUT           MOTION"] that there are physical processes in operation which           produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,           although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in           many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities           for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are           limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of           free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the           universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged           state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension           space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,           and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open           space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently           in the same location with respect to the natural reference           system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the           stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,           like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by           the progression of the natural reference system.  All           material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons           similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.            Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,           whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The           electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth           therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."                          Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are           also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a           particular frequency (above the "unit" frequency) spinning           around one axis at a particular rate (below the "unit" rate).            ("Unit velocity" is the speed of light, and there are           vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,           according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the "above" and           "below" labels mixed up.]                    Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of           light                    If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION           fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these           electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a           charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to           achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge           is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular           frequency (above the "unit" frequency) superimposed on the           rotation of the particle.)                      The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to           confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is           generated in clouds.           SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical           universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has           been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in           his first book "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE".                    It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,           and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call           "science" (or "physics", or "astronomy", etc.), as well as           the "scientific" literature and the "education" systems, to           TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.                    Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many           things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such           as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                    Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY           discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,           in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles           of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses           at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and           elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a           worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTPList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.eduor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is theversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory onexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bitsinternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bitdisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV toconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to checkthe "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file willbe blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefullyA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS (30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, 25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, 20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry (30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, 15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, 20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, 20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware (40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, 20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, 30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about 22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.

To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution onesFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tglcs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.educarnegie

However, theconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for ahuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economicbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developedand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.

From: dmcaloontuba.calpoly.edu (David McAloon)Subject: PLANETS STILL: IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWISTOrganization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis ObispoLines: 234 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe "orbital" motion  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.   I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge  1  I dream like this: ether based reality   The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the latticesboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])    The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of theearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged aroundby the sun's ether feild.  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the "path" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.   With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as "earth's" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size?   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S E       /     \                M    |      |      OR                M             \ _ _ /                                S                                    The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rateof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium)  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I could get with my machine's receiver next to it.    If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY All of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die)  Warning about writing to the past:I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by "advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind.   MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)  Accepting rides to the past:Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.   How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?   In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos" They said, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.   Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of.   I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.

However, it is unlikelythat the object is placed so conveniently.  Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannotknow what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume thatthey are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of thescreen).

From: ederhsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)Subject: Re: Elevator to the top floorOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, ALLines: 56Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, theirERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressivestrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,therefore the theoretical height for a constant section columnthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,or 75 Statute miles.Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a trusstype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constantsection column.  A constant section column is not the limit on how high you canbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross sectionas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 poundload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity incalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column crosssectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structurebelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross sectionto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mileof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the wayto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoreticallimit on area, although there will be practical limits basedon how much composites we can afford to by at 40/lb, and howmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you needa foundation that the bedrock can support.Let us arbitrarily choose 1 billion as the limit in costructioncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,assuming our finished structure costs 100/lb.  The 40/lb figureis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload massratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the towerheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significantatmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will stillhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losseswill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component ofrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thusthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets startingfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider windloads.  These will require more structural support over the first15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a lowenough value for it not to be a big factor.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, takingappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so anyof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of thegalaxy.          Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from thevarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, eitherPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on ourcatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropicdistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs ofhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we aresampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, Isuppose you are saying, "Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside thedisk."  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less aninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay outto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors detect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane fromthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mileaway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of hisarbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybefind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.          I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As Isaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (shorttimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type ofbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be boundto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely seenot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none ofthese characteristics.                  I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knowssomething that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor oftaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of thesedifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possibledistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a funfield.

From: robertcpuserver.acsc.com (Robert Grant)Subject: Virtual Reality for X on the CHEAPOrganization: USCACSC, Los AngelesLines: 187Distribution: worldReply-To: robertcpuserver.acsc.com (Robert Grant)NNTP-Posting-Host: cpuserver.acsc.comHi everyone,I thought that some people may be interested in my VRsoftware on these groups:*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Realitysystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.Features:   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).   Generic clients.   Customizable servers.   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily        attached.Functionality:  Client:   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to   other users.   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)    o User Interface Panels    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for	faster frame rates)    o Mouse and Keyboard Input   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because   I don't have one This will, however, be one of the first enhancements)  Server(s):   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is   provided in this release for potential world server developers:    o Transparent Client Management    o Client Message Handling   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache ofaccepting and   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - theapplication writer   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension        initialisers you want.    o Event Handler Registration:        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)    o Collision Detection Registration:        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide        some basic information to the collision detection management software.        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects    from which to choose.    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:    o Provide an initWorld function:        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus        any initialization you want to do.    o Provide a positionObject function:        This is where you determine where to place a new client.    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.    o Provide a getWorldType function:        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.    o Provide an animateWorld function:        This is where you can go wild At a minimum you should let the objects        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit        (to avoid outrunning the clients).    That's all there is to it And to prove it here are the line counts for the    three world servers I've provided:        generic - 81 lines        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the                           stairs Will probably be improved with future                           versions)        dogfight - 72 linesLocation:   This software is located at the following site:   ftp.u.washington.edu   Directory:   pub/virtual-worlds   File:   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.ZFutures:   Client:    o Texture mapping.    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading    o HMD support.    o Etc, etc....   Server:    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction    o Etc, etc....   Both:    o Improved CommsI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiversesoftware,unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not surewhether that will ever be able to be rectified :-(I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations ofthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and Iwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)Finally one major disclaimer:This is totally amateur code.

SpectrumLines: 137       Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association "Spectrum" offer       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of       controllers.                     SOFTWARE            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for       non professional users.            There are next possibility:       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;       - read - white image to - from disk;       - print image on the printer;       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;       - filter image;       - work with gistogramme;       - edit image.       - include users exe modules.                     CONTROLLER VS9       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from       a field of 724x600 pixels.       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal       and vertical directions.       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.                     CONTROLLER VS52       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was       created on the base of modern elements, including user       programmable gate arrays.       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning       devices).       The controller has the following technical characteristics:       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64       to 1024x512 pixels ;       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024       pixels;       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024       pixels ;       - number of gray level - 256 ;       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;       - 4 input video multiplexer ;       - input/output lookup table (LUT);       - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external       controlling signal) ;       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -       digital converter;       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the       controller by reprogramming it.              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV       signal in real time.

Spaceflight is NOT in this position.The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the longtransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't tofund these as long as something was known about the potential for profitat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amountof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you askme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, Ican't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded byexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, andwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industrieswill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested tostart them, etc.--  Keith Mancus    <mancusbutch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancussweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |  when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |

Most software production is at this level.2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration   management and quality assurance.3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the   project.4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts   are effective and certified.Nick Haines nickhcmu.edu

(1/3.4)    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km	 g  p  f  n	       (1/6)    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface					    e		      t			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for			      other bodies.		(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p	  a   t							    t			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U			       a			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average			      rock on the continental shields.    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).							    (1/3.4)    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U			      nuclear test crater.	      3		   2		       19    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3    assuming simple scaling laws.

The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication "Map Projections--A Working Manual", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's 20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. 14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

They'll quote a price, you send a    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up    for you. Add about a 3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than   just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is notwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using 1000 (1000R?) billsto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would bespent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of fundinghigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund variousfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to thedefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC tofund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-Europeancooperation.Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste ofmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count asinvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look atthe size of that multiplier :->).Nick Haines nickhcmu.edu

Thissummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held inSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised bythe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre forthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few       examples.-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was theworld's largest telecommunications satellite; and no othersatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining fourdifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to someof the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite isgiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques orservices; over the past four years some 200 companies andorganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learningorganisation.As the new technologies and services tested by theseOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they thenmake use of operational satellites such as those ofEUTELSAT.OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches theend of its design life.

The    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second    edition of the guide.    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of    "Space Jobs" features strategies for entering the space field and    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

Bussard, Journal of	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the	    thrust-power "gain" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, "high-thrust"	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer	    "high-thrust" flight capability. One performance example shows a	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in	    Earth/moon space.

[This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version	    of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim	    Bowery]	"PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications", by	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]    ION DRIVES:	Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE	archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the	SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in	the 1960s and 70s.

From: szabotechbook.com (Nick Szabo)Subject: SSF Redesign: ConstellationSummary: decentralize & automate functionsKeywords: space station, constellationArticle-I.D.: techbook.C51z6E.CL1Organization: TECHbooks --- Public Access UNIX --- (503) 220-0636Lines: 89SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right thistime  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:[1] microgravity/vacuum process research[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)[3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over 50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization.[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab forshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellationtether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,testing out the actual environment at low cost before billionsare spent on astronauts.[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can bespun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy, and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can studylife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purposeorbits.N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology canbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecologygreenhouses on Mars at low cost.-- Nick Szabo					 szabotechboook.com

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSIONNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE The Docs now contain a chapter forC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me.The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls fromthe FPU version to make it run faster.Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.********Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:-------------------------------------Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules?And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it?Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on.GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallelprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showingoff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explainwhat it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines withdata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routinesto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines soyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3Dgraphics and how to use the package.If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use fora lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.Enjoy,Christian Franz

This would be a positive life saverfor African or other drought affected countries. Implementing aclean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to suchcountries and should cut down mortalities considerably.So how about it?

Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memorywas successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare forMagnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in FlightSequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of PayloadData System Random Access Memory will take place this morningbeginning at 10:30 AM.Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands toperform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data foranalysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillatortesting will take place on Monday .The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, withactivation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified toinclude Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 dueto Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrumentcalibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize thespacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurementswhich occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will requirethe sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin stateand perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data pointsin varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Marstravelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) withrespect to Mars.  One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38seconds.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For muchof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down theindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retiredand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the pointwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note thatthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.

Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry theNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money andmerchants to put up the rest.

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire aMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporationscan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required werewithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were wellwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that onlya gov't could afford to set up a 1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply bytaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a planethat could take off and fly the profile would be handed 3B, no questionsasked.--  Keith Mancus    <mancusbutch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancussweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |  when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  |

What I completly disagree with is seperating thatintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is calledleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility forthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadershipand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set upas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFCand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston tofinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of theprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is thatfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of theturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It islack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack ofleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only asymptom of a greater national problem.

I'm gearing up to   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,   How many people do you want to share the colony with?    What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?     Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.Here's the (edited) responses I got:   How many people do you want to share the colony with? 100   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize thepercentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if therewere to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.And everyone, especially me, likes to "go exploring"...I would want to be ableto go for a walk and see something different each time...=============================================================================For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enoughto have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town"everybody knows everything" syndrome, which some people like butI don't.  Call it several thousand people.For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enoughto contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable timegetting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enoughfor there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter 1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command losstimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verifythe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experimentdata; long term trend analysis is continuing.6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine theoptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level.7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thrusterflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushedduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significantchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 260 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verifythe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacementfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetryrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC TelemetrySubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA wasnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTSdata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) ofthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have beentransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in thesequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated inthe sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead.

The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from thewing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and forcecompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bendinto,  then drag is reduced.   Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulfremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings aresubtract, teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage.pat

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas    scintillation proportional counters.    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true    nature of Saturn's rings.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity    map.    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for    one martian year (687 days).    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or inhassles.The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting tothe Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practicallydown in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses anynew problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyunsand beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (formore than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can developa new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clippermight be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are lessambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doingsustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wastingmoney in a big way.Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* aminor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, whichdominates the cost of the project.-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer  U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henryzoo.toronto.edu  utzoohenry

From: goltzmimi.UU.NET (James P.

Itwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one toten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the mainspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfermomentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosionheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock waveinto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see aregoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagneticradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fissionproducts).  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very muchmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seemsto me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombsout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them oncethey're there.  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?  Thanks.-- 	--Jim---Jim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltzuunet.uu.net

Any three of them must benon-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surfaceof a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise eitherthey cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BCand CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All pointson this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (infact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the planecontaining this normal and D (if D lies on the normal anyplane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right anglesto the ABC one.Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumferenceof the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on thenormal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicularbisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D isnot in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).Algorithm:Is the sphere well defined?

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on yourcalculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but Idon't think it is a BIOS mode.

Theyalso give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in PostScriptenvironments where it is absent.The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpointsof a line using the following formula for each coordinate:	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25	Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  Fromreading I thought that what they might actually do is:	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25	This results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" whichever is closer.By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find thatneither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPSresult looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know ifanyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.Thanks,--Stevesqueegeeworld.std.com

This scheme was competingwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except nowI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the earlyresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development. The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-Dwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know aboutlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches whichare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake thingsup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragilething and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support whilebolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road trackand erected on the pad?  They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of courseany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from theUS at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are politicalproblems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmaildecwrl.dec.com    or bitftppucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions    on how to make requests.    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.VIEWING IMAGES    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP    sites.    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.ONLINE ARCHIVES    NASA AMES    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).    To access the archives by email, send a letter to    archive-serverames.arc.nasa.gov (or amesarchive-server). In the    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:	send SPACE Index	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this    section for images or programs.    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are    available in these collections.    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee    (yeeames.arc.nasa.gov).    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results.

NASA SPACELINK    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop    between the user and NASA.    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the    Internet.

In order to turn thespacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will beavailable, or you need to retrain a new team.Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a "standby" mode foruse in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is stillrequired to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance isrelatively cheap.Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenanceto stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from timeto time.In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.David W.

April 23, 1993(Phone:  202/358-1780)Kyle HerringJohnson Space Center, Houston(Phone:  713/483-5111)RELEASE:  93-76HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 toservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 daymission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capabilityfor an additional two, if needed.	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, wasreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver timesrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actualEVA tasks on previous missions.	"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three isto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to thedynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said."It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing addedflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of thespacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arraysand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the CorrectiveOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectivesduring the mission.	"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest throughlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for eachspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead FlightDirector for the mission.	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of twoalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew thanprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.	"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previousspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"Heflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary toformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possibleto accomplish the mission objectives."	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessionsthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integratedsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand aloneunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will bemade based on actual training experience during the months prior to themission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flightwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will includespacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between theactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks atthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,Huntsville, Ala.	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gainingfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand theexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers andtrainers.	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built withgrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At thattime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may havebecome necessary.- end -     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

The magnitude of such accelerations heestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may notbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was publishedin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is verylong-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations infact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices ofcourse. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?Can this be extended to larger accelerations?Thanks is advance...-Amruth Laxman

I've typed it in verbatim, for youfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recentlydiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign GuidanceDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science andTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate ofthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the SpaceStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance tothe committee in their deliberations on the redesign ofthe space station.A low option of 5 billion, a mid-range option of 7billion and a high option of 9 billion will beconsidered by the committee. Each option would coverthe total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds fordevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttleintegration, facilities, research operations support,transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within theavailable funds.Over the next 5 years, 4 billion is reserved withinthe NASA budget for the President's new technologyinvestment. As a result, station options above 7billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions inthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a spacestation option of 9 billion would require 2 billionin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.Gibbons presented the information at an organizationalsession of the advisory committee. Generally, themembers-designate focused upon administrative topicsand used the session to get acquainted. They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientationon the process the Station Redesign Team is followingto develop options for the advisory committee toconsider.Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, andCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in thecourse of the space station redesign process.To that end, the Russians will be asked to participatein the redesign effort on an as-needed consultingbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of theirexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and thepossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities andsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope tobenefit from the expertise of the Russian participantsin assessing Russian systems and technology. Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to developoptions for reducing station costs while preserving keyresearch and exploration capabilities. Carefulintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor inachieving that goal.Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton iscommitted to the redesigned space station and to makingevery effort to preserve the science, the technologyand the jobs that the space station program represents.However, he also is committed to a space station thatis well managed and one that does not consume thenational resources which should be used to invest inthe future of this industry and this nation."NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Marylandunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

From: boebertsctc.com (Earl Boebert)Subject: Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings?Organization: SCTCLines: 47Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case aboat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set ofreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using YaronDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program whichconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you clickthe mouse.Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that comeout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant waysfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because thescanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there aresuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion andcontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,scanner errors and what have you.The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, orrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm forremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets ofpoints Reference(x,y) (the known true values)DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply toDistortedData to remove the errors.I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distortedreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3dsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to removethe errors in the other data points.Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?Thanks,Earl

Currently, mining companiescan get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices --something like 50  The mining lobby has for decades managed to blockany reform of these outdated fees.  In fact, the latest attempt to reformthem was again blocked -- President Clinton "compromised" by taking themining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separatelegislation to fight that battle.If you want to discuss this further, I suggest you take this to talk.environment.G.

Off the top of my head, I might try:Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4),        dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)p_c is the same distance from our four points, sodist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) testand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test wereperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna 1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meterantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysisis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailedinformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degreesto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalancemeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).

The commentaries included are my thoughts on these developments.     Sigh... as usual, I've gotten behind in getting this column written.  I can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in the space biz.  This column is put together at lunch hour and after the house quiets down at night, so data can quickly build up if there's a lot of other stuff going on.  I've complied a lot of information and happenings since the last column, so I'm going to have to work to keep this one down to a readable length.

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about 4,890 M.    In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth 1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth  670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans."                              Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to 1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to 250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth 100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business.    Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top 5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.    Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.)    It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The 60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.    The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final.    The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth 7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  Under this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request.     [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about 2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of 300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company.     However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.    Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth.    [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners.     It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.    There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]                  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"    Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-generating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see 70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and 100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.    [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about 560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about 25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses.    In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the 700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade.    Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.    Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.    Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO.    Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders.    One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.    [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit.   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars.     For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic.    Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals.    And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.    We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT    The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules.     In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call.    Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.    Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch.   [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.     At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch.     As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems).     I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.    [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.    This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.    [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development.     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs?  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment?     Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has  30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US.    [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system).     This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware.    Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.    What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system.    It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a 6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an 8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main alternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified.    [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.     PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors.     PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 550 K  (Some sources place this of high as 1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional 20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.    The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single 6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US 10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels.     [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T13.6 B (US 530 M) through 2006.     I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures.    The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-2", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed.    In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US22 B in research and development and another US17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000.                                    [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market.    As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.    South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US 8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-monitoring micro-satellite.    This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors.   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US  500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula.          In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).     This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

The article starts with "A leaderof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the plannedspace station said yesterday the job is tough and maybe impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it ispossible to cut costs that much and still provide formeaningful research "is a real question for me."O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with theaerospace industry, chopping management of the spacestation program at some NASA facilities around thecountry, working closely with the Russian space stationMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement themanned space shuttle fleet."O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design optionsso far, and they are sorting the serious candidatesinto three categories based on cost.The Post says O'Connor described the design derivedfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believeKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. Ilistened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the presson Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connortalked about how the White House wants three options,sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another partof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he hasformed to look at three options [SSF derivative  LaRC,modular buildup with Bus-1  MSFC, and Single LaunchCore ["wingless Orbiter"]  JSC. Later, in response toa reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor saythe option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate"cost option, in between low & high cost options. Notthe "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote).The article goes on to describe the other two optionsas "one features modules that could gradually be fittedtogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. Theother is a core facility that could be deposited inorbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That optionwould use existing hardware from the space shuttle -the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure."The last sentence in the article contradicts the title& the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He[O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the plannedspace station Freedom is still possible within theadministration's budget guidelines."

The hobbyhas been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using atotal impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified periodof time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, andall of the launches are then covered under this "blanket waiver".There is also a "High Power Safety Code" which designates morespecific rules such as launch field size, etc.Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket motors you need to certified through either the National Associationof Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association.

Mitchell                          March 23, 1993 INTRODUCTION: In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, areal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to testtele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individualslocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainmentpurposes.Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation andtele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing ofinformationon methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout ofalunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminatingeducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity andachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate inTwenty-First century remote learning methods. Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interestsandskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,interfacingand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolvingplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students andprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal ata participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models attheLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a realfacilityexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of theconstructionof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggestedby the users themselves. This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN: A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are usedfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.The "floor" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributionsis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design andcreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, andmachine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals. The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trainswith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and controlelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user willreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of theirdata link to LTM1. Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from aservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for theSSTOto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunarlandscape and land. Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equippedbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operatorsworldwideto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing andtakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based oncommerciallyavailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for theinterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advancedham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers. By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and addinga tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can beprovided in under 80 man hours. PLAN OF ACTION: The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project byproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual constructionof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can bemodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide "rail stock"for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphicalcommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.An initial "ground breaking" with miniature shovels will be performed fora live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initialmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started forhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completelyserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additionalbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present andthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distributionworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will beissuedcalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scalemodelsfor the simulated lunar colony. A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will thenbeannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being tofind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects ofthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at thattimethe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors willthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they returntotheir campus. A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and viaconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipmentaddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photoopportunity for the television community. Especially since the "action"willbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will beinvited to issue "challenges" to engineering and human factors students atuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to performlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may besimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges. The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,experimentationand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being alongterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the genericexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limitedto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which canlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars CONCLUSION: EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who hasever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of aglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentationpurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only createworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that requirereal(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds inspace.

Beyond that, I have no other info.The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside ofthe orbit of Mercury.The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observedperihelion precession and the value it should have had according toNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observationsand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe laterimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's systemof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptuneand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbitof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing wasafoot with Mercury.But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rateit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantlycurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamicsof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one ofit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precessionof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb'snumbers rather than Leverrier's.)Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequentefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radarhave been fruitless.-Bill Gawne "Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe  are the laws of the universe."                       - G.

Massive amounts of regolith wouldhave to be processed.This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moonas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn'tcontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though themarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around .06/pound.This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; "high-Ti" basalts (Apollo 11and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched intitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, andsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over theworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  Ifeven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Tibasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the mooncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of theore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores beingmined today).

From: kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.govSubject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative 4Organization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Lines: 71I have 19 (2 MB worth) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outliningone of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered inCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and canbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail atmholdermjscprofs.nasa.gov.Mark proposed this design, which he calls "Geode" ("rough on theoutside, but a gem on the inside") or the "ET Strongback withintegrated hab modules and centrifuge."  As you can see from filegeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of muchof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  Thewhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station RemonteManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrustingcan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the massproperties of the Station change during assembly.The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily becauseit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strongpart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces arelimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of thedocking system.The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additionallaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've neverhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventualde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent theresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit fromimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy aKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminatingthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providingfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as thenucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control MomentGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be usedfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit systemwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform acontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like wedid with Skylab).The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could beused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravityon humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage devicefor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted onone of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF workdone to date.Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumorsI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiterseems more likely.Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;you should see his notes in the GIF files.  Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these foranon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

From: rwscs.arizona.edu (Ronald W. Schmidt)Subject: outlining of spline surfaceKeywords: spline rasterizationLines: 38	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared tobe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering ifanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published solutions to it.	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by tworoughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentiallystarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extantbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw the object we 1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable	measure.2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.3) Depth sort the triangles4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge	colored with a special "edge color"	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of theproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps inthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.They involve both rasterization problems and problems resultingfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problemsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in thisarea.-Thanks

It's fairly old today, but it still serves some people in  Mech. Eng. Depts.  Now it's superseded from CQUEL.BYU (pronounced "sequel"). That's a  complete modelling, animation and visualization package. Runs in the usual  workstation environments (SUN, DEC, HP, SGI, IBM RS6000, and others)  You can get a demo version (30-days trial period) either by sending 20  USD in their address or a blank tape. It costs 1,500 for a full run-time  licence.  Contact:  Engineering Computer Graphics Lab  368 Clyde Building, Brigham Young Univ.

Scene description languages==============================NFF---  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)OFF---  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rostkpc.com).[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version, I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this  service, send a message with a "Subject:" line containing only the word  "help" and a null message body to: object-archive-serverdecwrl.dec.com.  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,  also on gondwana.TDDD----It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,3):  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley  (worleycup.portal.com)  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views  in Postscript.P3D---  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.RenderMan---------  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.==========================================================================8. Solids description formats=============================a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325  and the cost is 100.  This standard is not available in electronic format.c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptservercme.nist.gov  and putting the line	send index  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

Features===========DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC: - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA) - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for   VGA and many Super-VGAs...4. Technical information========================The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2](not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zerocoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Maindifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supportedalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option touse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturationdominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality ofthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributedover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space pointsis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at theexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lyingsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximatedby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead ofconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to thelower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes thanto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improveon NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redishareas....--Stefan Eckart, stefanlis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de

Whengraphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) thearea on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraftdoesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)envelope'. Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actuallyflies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there areare the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilotsdo for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close thecorrespondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- inessence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to wherethe airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this isdone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generallycarefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and howfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speedtaxi tests).I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know aboutthis process (and then some).-- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fred.McCalldseg.ti.com - I don't speak for others and they don't speak for me.

Displaying all 256 levelssynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. Afterexperimenting with different aperture settings and screenbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectablecontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were novisible contrast bands.To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixelsthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that wasvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating theseframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camerashutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrotedirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in thetop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It tookan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because theprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images intothe center of the print.

I have several friends at the Moscow AviationInstitute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have donesome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the originalannouncement.) For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it isthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the trainingof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframedesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained atMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of anF-111(), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye openingexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a yearor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity tosee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive enginesfor future space craft use.If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I wouldbe glad to try and answer them.

(818) 354-5011Contact:  Mary A. HardinFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 19931506     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report thesuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed tomeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airportreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and tookmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate datawith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).       The data from the balloon flight will also be compared toreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttleDiscovery.     "We launch these balloons several times a year as part of anongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is activelyinvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in threeimportant ways," said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator onthe balloon research campaign.       "There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite," hecontinued.  "The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truthfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its ownright."     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add morepieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically themid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helpsscientists construct more accurate computer models which areinstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLinstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measuresozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwaveradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fouriertransform infrared interferometer which monitors how theatmosphere absorbs sunlight.      Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to groundstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commandedto separate from the balloon.     "We needed to fly through sunset to make the infraredmeasurements," Margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly indarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."     It will be several weeks before scientists will have thecompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forwardtheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARSscientists.         The balloon was launched by the National Scientific BalloonFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under acontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon waslaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind directionand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less thanone-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubicmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated withhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weighbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  Thescientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) poundsand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's UpperAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative MeasurementsProgram.                                                           ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                  | instead.

There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.>An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed>by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the>center of the sphere.

It's more likely that the Moon will neverbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has nomaterials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroidsand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in lowgrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" militaryweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to preventcalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it'stoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factoriesthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Lunahas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbitalsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offersa source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light andheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravitywells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtuallyignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have todeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much moreexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use theeasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a fewcenturies, if not much longer.Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radioastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the siteof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system fordefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first isunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are goodenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe forconventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from abunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges.

It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of SpaceIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of theNational Space Society, which is an international non-profitorganization that promotes development of the space frontier.The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road 100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Supports 24-bit display"HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other   palettes can be generated.Supported functions include such niceties as the following:o  image & image: + - / * interpolationo  image & constant: + - / *o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

The author is not responsible for any         damage caused by this program.Important changes since version 1.30:    Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).    Improve file management system (more user-friendly).    Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.    Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.    Fix bug in GEM/IMG reading.    Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.    Auto-skip macbinary header.(1) Introduction:  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different  formts.  Include simple file management system.  Support 'slide show'.  There is NO LIMIT on image size.  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  * 80387  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  * DPMI  * Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory  model, SVGA graphics.(3) Installation:  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible   with original version)+  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with+      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,+      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment    GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                 Other drivers are not tested.              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.(7) Detail:   Initialization:      Set default display type to highest display type.      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.+       The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written.

Subject: Space FAQ 01/15 - IntroductionFrom: leechcs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:53:44 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <intro_730956346cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 310Archive-name: space/introLast-modified: Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10     FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO    INTRODUCTION    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenetgroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers tofrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worthpreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleechcs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.    3) Miscellanous queries.    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of    FAQ postings.    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth	100 posts).    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST	not SPACE.    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all	references.)    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the	'reply' function of mailers will work.    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone	will get on TV anyway.    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals	(use carriage returns).    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each    posting.

Can you land a shuttle with a 5cm hole in the wall?Personnally, I don't know, but I'd like to try it sometime.Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole inthe wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn'tcause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There area few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especiallyif the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out theother side, as could easily happen with a meteor strike.

For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you findthe original ellipse analytically?I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinearprogramming technique to deal with this problem approximately.Any ideas will be greatly appreciated.

From: ederhsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)Subject: Re: Guns for SpaceKeywords: Sopa Gun, Space LauncerOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, ALLines: 72Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for theLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas gunshave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physicallylocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that theoffice he works for is an administrative convenience.I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamberabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at severalhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the pistonis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tensof atmospheres.The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it untila stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inchbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. theyintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrelcould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having tomove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being usedin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameterand about 50 cm long.All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogengas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves thebarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with asheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  Theplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trappedin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plasticwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plasticprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,the projectile vaporizes.The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range isabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 kmif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gunto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they canfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFBto follow the projectiles.The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last testthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think ithad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, butI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).There are people waiting to test scramjet components in thisgun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basicallya proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kguseful payload to orbit.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

Digital immortality.The basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks   are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on themwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be theartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in differentformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll bethere...and someone will dig them up.   If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critiqueand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closesand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hangas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons. Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your owncopies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...that's what they're here for.---------------------------------------------------------------WHERE?             OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.    	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site			sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)Merely "anonymous FTP" to either site on Internet and change to theappropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the "bin"command to make sure you're in binary.OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around NorthAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply ofOTIStuff...	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron-------------------------------------------------------------- HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?              What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-putit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated worksare also welcome.OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bittougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    JPG files to a standard GIF format. OTIS also accepts animation files.      When you submit image files, please send me email at the same timestating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to beused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for peopleto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'llbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of emailing).If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely sendcopies to:The OTIS Projectc/o Ed StastnyPO BX 241113Omaha, NE 68124-1113I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in thedirectory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to whatthe images are to be named, include those as well.   Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, pleasecontact me and we'll arrange things.If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5"disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBMcompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF orJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rathernot have to.At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as theycan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can senda blank disk and an SASE (or 2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS.As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  Email me for current archive size and directory.--------------------------------------------------------------------DISTRIBUTION?The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it isnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format toanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport theappropriate text files along with the images.   It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post imagesfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them soparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much aspossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favoriteBBS system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  It would bekeen of you.--------------------------------------------------------------------USE?If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, orfull address credit).  You will either find this in the ".rm" file for    the image or series of images...or in the "Artists" directory under the Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, emailme (edcwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for you, or give you their contact information. When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artistknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some suchcompensation for their files.---------------------------------------------------------------------NAMING IMAGES?Please keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  That means, keepthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The wayI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three orfour digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be somethinglike: 	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETCKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename willremain intact on all systems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREATING IMAGE FILES?When creating image files, be sure to at least include your namesomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference incase they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,address or other information you'd like people to know.-----------------------------------------------------------------------HMMM?That's about it for now.

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faintones to be consistent with being equally dense for as faras we can see--it is as if they are all contained withina finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at thecenter.  (These measurements are statistical, and you canalways hide a sufficiently small number of a differenttype of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assumingthat there is only one population of GRBs).The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the centerof the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact centerof are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of cometsway beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placingGRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies tobe released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud modelstend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane ofthe Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if theyare Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years inradius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the AndromedaGalaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)

Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would dependupon whether the Soviets tried to go.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remotesensing techniques. 		   Intuitive Graphic Interface	Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing andanalysis simple and fast.	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returningto the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.		    Image Format Compatibility	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily openand save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or realdata values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formatsas well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.		    Image Analysis & Processing	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes anassortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution product or principal component analyses.An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allowsthe user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trigonometric and transcendental functions.		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivityfor various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric andsurface conditions and instrument spectral bands.A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,and 3-D image projection.		    Easy External Program Interfacing	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externallydeveloped software algorithms for processing and converting satelliteobservations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parametersto external programs using special interface functions.		    Quick Quality Presentation	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolutionmultispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 imageplanes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifyingand integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scaleoutput for standard inkjet and laser printers.	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?		    Software Support & Development	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA) of the Universite de Lille, France.The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists atthe French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changingresearch needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which featureson-line help, is supported by an Internet address sphinxloasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without delay.		    Performance Tested 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Centerand is widely used in many French laboratories, includingthe Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique.   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE. HOWEVER THE   VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS   SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH.   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING "SPHINX", SEND US YOUR EMAIL   AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE EVOLUTION.   THE SOFTWARE IS CHANGING WITH USER SUGGESTIONS WE WILL   APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS.

However, the rumors>I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter>seems more likely.Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things Both the "External Tank" and"Wingless Orbiter" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the "giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles," and building a "station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed."Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option "A" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses "Bus-1", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A "Power Station Capability" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an "arrow mode" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option "B" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option "B" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option "A"). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options "A" and "B".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A "Two Fault Tolerance Capability" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.Option C - Single Core Launch Station.This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diametercylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines onthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocketmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against    micrometeroid & orbital debris)  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)  - 7 berthing ports  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet    (twice the volume of skylab).  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors  - 10 kW of housekeeping power  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)  - increased crew time for utilization  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module

As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reasonor another, but who will give you a "home".. Such as Saudia Arabia orwhatever..There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them andoffer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they willnot care.. If your worried about the US, do the same thing..Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have manyother things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or whatever..Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go alittle bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown topiss off..

We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input inaddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 graylevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how toformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initialproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from aparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the videosignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However theydid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, butthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and theywould call Japan, etc.Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel imagesfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's notlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information ongetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I wouldgreatly appreciate your sending it to me.Thanks.Allan WeberSignal & Image Processing InstituteUniversity of Southern Californiawebersipi.usc.edu

But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending onexactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from projectstart to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really wantspeed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still inservice as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF lessthan 18 months after the development go-ahead.One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the beliefthat you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spendingbillions of dollars.

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the problem.

Q. How do I become an astronaut?    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission    specialist".    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first".    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston, Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates    ==================================================================    Astronaut Candidate Program    ---------------------------    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description    ---------------------------------    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.    Astronaut Candidate Program    ===========================    Basic Qualification Requirements    --------------------------------    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to    submitting an application.    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic    preparation is important.    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/150 or better uncorrected,	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of    academic preparation is important.    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight    test experience highly desirable.    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/50 or better uncorrected	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.    Citizenship Requirements    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of    the United States.    Note on Academic Requirements    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the    sciences, are not considered qualifying:      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,	Medical Technology, etc.)      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).      - Degrees in Nursing.      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.    Application Procedures    ----------------------    Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to:	NASA Johnson Space Center	Astronaut Selection Office	ATTN: AHX	Houston, TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection    ---------    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits    ----------------    Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and    other similar military matters.NEXT: FAQ 15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services

From: baezguitar.ucr.edu (john baez)Subject: End of the Space AgeArticle-I.D.: galaxy.29034Organization: University of California, RiversideLines: 82Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.eduThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What's New" -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mindchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.   Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEWMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of amidlife crisis.The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies nolonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economicrewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's scienceand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not ameaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, ourtechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversionpolicy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over 30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda......."I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happennow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's JetPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We've put off a lot of things we shouldn'thave.... I would rather see a 10-billion NASA doing well than a40-billion one filled with white elephants."

Matthew    Wiener (weembalibra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamadayscvax.ysc.go.jp).US PLANETARY MISSIONS    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the    geological and biological sense.    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface    of an ocean.    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic    measurements of MARINER 4.    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket    launcher autopilot failed.    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever    to do so.    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before    its batteries failed.    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon    and drifted off into solar orbit.    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored    the Tycho crater region in 1968.    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut    down on April 12, 1980.    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10    satellites and one more ring were discovered.    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the    location of the heliopause.SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first	     craft in solar orbit.    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was	     also a test for future Mars missions.    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images	     from surface.    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in	      1972.    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in	      1976.    SOVIET VENUS PROBES    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions	       lost enroute in 1961.    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in	       February of 1966. No images were returned.    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles	       similar in 1969.    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in	       1972.    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar	       mission.    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in	     March of 1986.    SOVIET MARS PROBES    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased	     enroute the following year.    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red	     Planet in 1971.    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.	     probe MARINER 9.    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit	     with its flyby bus.    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to	       human/computer error.    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week	       before scheduled Phobos landing.    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their    space program remains to be seen.JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for    a Japanese spacecraft.    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the    approach:	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)	Period		: 4.7 daysPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market    bookstore.    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):      J.

Other works and periodicals:    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study    some of the books listed above.    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you    probably know.    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger   in and of it self did not uncover flaws.2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is   not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools   cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle   Language) is somewhat limited.3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team.   This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.4.

I liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return, by anon-governmental body..Also the idea of then having a moon habitat race.. I know we need to do somthing to get people involved..Eccentric millionaire/billionaire would be nice.. We see how old Ross feelsabout it.. After all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show hedoes care about commericalization and the people.. Will try to broach thesubject to him.. Moonbase on the cheap is a good idea..

Hiermee ontstond de tweedeuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerstewaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkundein de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar devoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studentensterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scalaaan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren eenplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantalvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de DiesNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Erstaat echter meer op stapel.Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan eensterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van hetsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van hethuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht dedeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven vande stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In deeerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers eenbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens eenhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindproduktenzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tothet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt opeen apart vel.Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaarsstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDENZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOMTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goedgaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de RadiosterrenwachtWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussenhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal vaneen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snelopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken entrachten te verklaren.Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met detechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijnnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30Watt een seconde te laten branden Tijdens het symposium zaler niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagsetechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) enf 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door hetverschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van deABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900.

That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possiblethat Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely thatLuna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundredyears at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on fundinglevels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can youput a 200 person base on the Moon for 30 million a year?

Please spread the word  Here's someinformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from JayGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse tolearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also havesome money available...John Spencer, 1993/04/21Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturnitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,(21:16-09:38 UT).

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen fromIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new aboutthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomyand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odellof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to myattention.THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?Jay Goguen (jdgscn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >100 for the data.  Jayand again:  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.jay     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

For a decade and more the punditshave told us - "you've lost it"  The "me" generation is onlyliving on the accomplishments of the past.     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  Welisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Livinghistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tellof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe asGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousanddollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken onlyof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that thebest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman andPoseidon ballistic missiles.     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listenedto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Letme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetusbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatestengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Yourinsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporatedinto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - asingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  Youadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as areall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  Youconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weldits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of aprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from thegeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinentalaviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a littleand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner whostarted this program for the SDI.     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't evenstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested alittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before theymoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or morebefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - youdidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going totake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusableaerospace transportation is real.     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  sameteam here today but a few years to show through the StrategicDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in abouta year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled ourcommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the SovietUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscoredthe importance of our work in bringing about a new internationalrelationship.     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place theframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for thenext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  Thissummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for thefirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next threeyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use spacerapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  Andyes - we'll make a little money off it too     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years tobuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 ofspace will be a reality  We may even be able to use some of therocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts tocounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap tothe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't SaturnV's  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extradollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbitalsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed theway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocketexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape theworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks athand     This project is real.  The torch of American technologicalgreatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine isAmerican.  Let's go fly it

Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far    exceed their technical skills.    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for    composing imagery for understanding.    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the    computer graphics context.

Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did youknow about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can preventyou from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.I say:What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislatingat all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, andwould consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal andaesthetic values that make us human.

I originallywrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someonehere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, butare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as anintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a*** different version.The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  Theyare fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a"virtual screen", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image withno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copyareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included asimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo programthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three "windows".The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04gIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.

From: Wales.Larrisonofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Space Clipper Launch ArticleX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 40To All -- I thought the net would find this amusing..  From the March 1993 "Aero Vision" (The newsletter for the Employeesof McDonnell Douglas Aerospace at Huntington Beach, California).    SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY    "On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the  cafeteria.    Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available  either in the 35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything  needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for 12 each.  Both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-  7302."  By the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor isit an advertisement to buy the product.

Others claim to be staying of their own freewill, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflictinginformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with theindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blowanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stoppedmanufacturing their own.Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group isequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces andpossibly Canon equipment.The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious toother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,including a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" andclaims to be the "MS-iah".Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speakhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There werefrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of"interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll onfederal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blaresthroughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his ownapocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakerscarry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "Iwant to welcome you to the 'Next World' ".- - -- Roland J.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell ScienceCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in SpaceMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of RockwellInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized worldauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written orcoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrialmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. DavidCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legalexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to buildthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with apotential to power the globe.   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly halffrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientificconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunarsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmittedthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormoussource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's everincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of SpaceIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of theNational Space Society, which is an international non-profitorganization that promotes development of the space frontier.The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersectingat a point. This might be easier to implement.-Stevespworleynetcom.com

Could> someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tellsit "If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrongwith your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search modein an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth."The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft'spoint of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything isfine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how longshould the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong andbegins to take corrective action?  That "how long" is the command loss timer.During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be setto rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo "expect tohear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours".

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The 25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.If memory serves, the 25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than 25,000.Could it work with the moon?

In fact, be-fore BATSE, having this widely separated "Interplanetary Network" was theonly sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannotlocate a burst (except to say "It's somewhere in the field of view.").  Withtwo detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detectorto narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of theselocations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, liketo comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seenin a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would bea mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gaussneutron star...but this is getting too far afield.Peterpeterfoddjob.uchicago.edu

(Healso noted that the software people were starting to feel managementpressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get thingsright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failureduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be countedon one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by theexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.(None of the experimenters could afford it.)-- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer  U of Toronto Zoology                    - Kipling           |  henryzoo.toronto.edu  utzoohenry

We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and|> Computer Graphics World magazine.Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effectsfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computergraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Eachframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render onhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphicswould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 framesper second).|> |> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading|> companies,|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visualdatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  Thisis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilottraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping ofthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motionof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics systemmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complexdata representations.Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhapsdue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what wasvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (thegraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constantframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in generaldoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified theUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-timeoperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-timeoperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, noteven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only ourmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation dueto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environmentsrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-timemulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systemson the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularlyimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is anunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to developVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

From: ykimcs.columbia.edu (Yong Su Kim)Subject: Fast wireframe graphicsDistribution: usaOrganization: Columbia University Department of Computer ScienceLines: 29I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the userbeing able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.  Also,the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes sothat they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframeworld.To do this, I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in theVan Dam, Foley and Feiner book, but I was wondering if there wasanother PD graphics package out there which was faster.  I would liketo make the program as fast as possible so that it providessatisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.Ideally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me toopen a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within thewindow.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driveninteraction handling since the user is going to move around thewireframe models using the keyboard.If you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you coulddirect me to a ftp site which contains the package.Thank you.-- ===============================================================================Yong Su Kim, Class of 1993		|  Internet: yk4cunixb.cc.columbia.eduColumbia College, Columbia University   |        or  ykimcs.columbia.edu

As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the PowerSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at aparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphicsarchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every18 months to 2 years.These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they becomealmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a newplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If wedon't, we become uncompetitive.From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets yourcurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, butif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Repfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Someof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such asthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Seriesmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtaina guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or ChallengeR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.|> |> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books|> just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of|> getting boned in the process.|> If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings ormis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy ourcustomer base.|> Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we|> aren't entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,|> for instance) are.

Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought thegamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected thatGRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactichalo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster wasprobably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halopopulation should show anisotropy (a local disk population isruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy youhave to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanismof getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should startto see for example the Andromeda's bursters.	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source withthe right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (henceisotropy) and the edge is "the edge of the Universe" ;-)If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron starcolliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then gettingthe spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.	If we know anything about physics at that level,the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmicstrings, wrong spectrum for one thing.The situation is further complicated by recent claims thatthere are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NSthey'd actually probably fit relatively easily into theNS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering   hyperspace :-)   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...*  Steinn Sigurdsson   			Lick Observatory      	**  steinlylick.ucsc.edu		"standard disclaimer"  	**  The laws of gravity are very,very strict			**  And you're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B. 1988*

Oh well.I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missionswere going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off handand I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: "Why can't we spend a few million moreto keep instruments that we already have in place going?"His responce was that there are only so many  available to him andthe lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etcis 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on usingcurrent instruments in the current budget enviroment he would havevery little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, surein the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,however starting a few years after he had retired he would becomeone of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for notfunding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Justas he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed itto whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing newmissions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments beforethe last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.-- Covert C Beachdragonaccess.digex.com

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficultto do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out     of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own    breathing effort (let alone anything else)  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough    gas per unit volume.   Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungsor interfere with their healing or anything like that... --Wim Lewis, wimlu.washington.edu

The       peakups were successful. The observations were executed as       scheduled, and no problems were reported.     o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet       Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus.

This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago. IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusingerrors in programs.There's two errors:  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of   original 24bit should be a special case  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases   in saving the image, if at all) ==clip====clip==[ ..deleted..]It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.It is error in design.It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;jpeg is not designed to that.As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays wereknown. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images onlyat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program thewhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.That were not done and now we have -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format) -the program has human interface errors.Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format withoutclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.[ ..deleted.. ]==clip==Some new items follows.==clip==I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24option than with default option we have.The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)the same than used in ppmquant.If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I foundthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used inrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so Ican say nothing about it.)==clip====clip==Some minor bugs in human interface are:Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happensthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrongplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come aboutfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboardand mouse for XV after the image is completed.Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just whenI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressingsthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XVupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values firstand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to beupdated when the setting are not ready yet.I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.==clip==

The meetings were part of "Space VLBI Week" held at JPL inearly March and were intended to maintain cooperation betweeninternational space agencies participating in the development ofthe U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flightproject set for launch in 1995.     U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft-- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellitewith its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up withground-based radio telescopes located around the world to createa radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radiotelescope observing power by a factor of 10.     Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit toconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraftwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratoryradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target forroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radiotelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source objectwhile within view on Earth.     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for theU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permitJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radiointerferometry, to establish working relationships with the radioastronomy communities that will be vital during the complexobservations required by the Space VLBI project.     "One of our main activities is developing the methodologyfor international coordination, because the two spacecraftsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations whileusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the samecelestial objects," said Smith.     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSNfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located inJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network ofground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks andhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward theinformation to a correlator located at the National RadioAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator willcombine and process data, then make it available to missioninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope createdby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers withbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before byground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take acloser look at distant objects in space.     "There is a long history of radio astronomy usingground-based telescopes," said Smith. "What we intend to do is toextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to lookdeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and otheractive radio sources to understand what drives those things wehave seen so far with radio astronomy."     Smith noted that if one examines "the active galacticnuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater thanlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greaterthan you would expect."     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may belocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuelthe jets. Smith hopes that "by using Space VLBI to look furtherinto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders andtransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, andJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later thisyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists andengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBACorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odddata patterns that will originate from the more than 20ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with theJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held atJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that thepolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country'sparticipation in the project.     "Nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the Russians havebeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated somelikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factorsbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping thesethings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more atstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to ascience mission.     "The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, sinceinternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,"he said.     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officialslook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcasethe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highlyregarded Mach V launch vehicle.     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such anambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for theSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial andpolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.     "Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, andif either falls out, we would still have something with theother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,scientifically exciting missions."                                ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder-- Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.

If you do, consider that you sawme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I wentdown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It'sjust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that'sno worse than your own.Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and mycomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-callingisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I mightsee it better, Fred."Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted mymotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (asyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care aboutpeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was toimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on privatemail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such ajerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables andbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuablepurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I triedto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried tocommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) jobwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don'thave the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.

Subject: Space FAQ 02/15 - Network ResourcesFrom: leechcs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)Expires: 6 May 1993 19:54:26 GMTOrganization: University of North Carolina, Chapel HillKeywords: Frequently Asked QuestionsSupersedes: <net_730956391cs.unc.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.eduLines: 241Archive-name: space/netLast-modified: Date: 93/04/01 14:39:15 NETWORK RESOURCESOVERVIEW    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to    special 'servers'.    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more    specialized mailing lists described below.    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was    posted.    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make    it the preferred option.MAILING LISTS    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the    International Space University (in only its second change of management    in over a decade). Email space-requestisu.isunet.edu (message body    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README    for further details.    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources    as they are released. Email to elements-requesttelesoft.com to join.    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to    gps-requestesseye.si.com to join.    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vaccs.cmu.edu) to join.    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to    space-tech-requestcs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email    LISTSERVTAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your    name". Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents.    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email    LISTSERVTAMVM1.BITNET saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name" to join.    Email saying "INDEX SEDSNEWS" to list the archive contents.    Ron Baalke (baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him    to join the list.    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list    address rather than the request address.PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION    In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is    posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group    sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the    individuals posting this information are performing a service for all    net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

The training course will discuss the applications ofsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energyand the environment.The training course, organised for the benefit of francophoneAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European SpaceAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible forcoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensingsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, westernand central Africa, and three regional African centres, willattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remotesensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1data.The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radarinstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensingmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year2000. The aim of the training course is to increase thepotential of experts using the practical applications of radarremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energyand the environment, with particular emphasis on applicationsto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.The education and practical training programme wasdeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA. Thefacilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers andinformation documents for the training course, will beprovided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course willinclude high-level experts from other European and Africanorganisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds forthe training course are being provided by the United NationsTrust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; theprimary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.A similar training course is being planned for Latin Americanexperts.

At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold   all info, what is the trick to do fast image manipulation?  I   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questionswould be greatly appreciated.  Please send me mail.  Thanks in advance*************************************************************************                         Tiang   T.

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahineand Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab DirectorDr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, andfelt "like royalty," he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt toexplain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternatedimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, "because whileI'm most interested in those things in space that are fartheraway, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."     Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduatestudents and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office ofFlight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's projectscientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.     Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paidto a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Shouldextraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,they would find a variety of images that would explain somethingof Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating withthe spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.     Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutesdescribing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answerto a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposeddrag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's onlya concept." Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about fiveyears before, described the professor as "a living miracle of thepower of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good senseof humor."     The next stop, a demonstration on scientific datavisualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab,entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned gogglesto view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jongshowed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently beendiscovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious aboutits composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, heasked several questions on their interpretation.     Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and DataAcquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight OperationsFacility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.     The day ended with two technical discussions of particularinterest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. FrankEstabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist describeda three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained thephilosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.     The Hawking party, which had been visiting SouthernCalifornia for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, andplanned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Labtour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promisedChahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.                               ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

From: jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)Subject: DC-Y trajectory simulationKeywords: SSTO, Delta ClipperOrganization: University of Illinois at UrbanaLines: 91I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing asingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled "Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University ofIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories anddetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he isnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the detailsof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hopethey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you willbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  Themain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume thatthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but Idid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boostersand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelsonshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:                  ______3 G         /|   /      |           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly           /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.1 G   /                 |                        |                        |0 G                     |             ^          ^           ~100 sec    ~400 secAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel theaccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so itsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer enginesbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cutout entirely.The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimedfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges ofair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than    all at once?A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?A:  Can't tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protectingnational security or MD protecting their own interests?The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitchup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphsof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would haveabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about thataspect of the flight profile.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    "Find a way or make one."	             -attributed to Hannibal

Mckissock)Subject: NASA "Wraps"News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41    Nntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.govOrganization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, OhioLines: 133In the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:  "Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes   the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   that: Of the 30 billion cost of Freedom, fully 10   billion won't be spent on anything having anything   to do with Space Stations Now, maybe that 10 billion   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are   getting and the price they are paying and note that   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware   that a third of the money is going for something else."My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A coupleof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, Italked with one of the cost experts here in Space Stationat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post aresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposedto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHzdata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty lowon the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekendin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSFto 15,000 science teachers.]First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' doesexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around 40 Million.This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is04/2.2 = 1.8%Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of 30billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to540 million. This is alot less than 10 billion, but Iwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocketchange.I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 couldbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on fundsthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at somestates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eatthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get ittake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fundswe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers infront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 fundsgo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a taxrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at thecenter, and not to the prime contracts.This leads to the obvious question "What is the governmentdoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie. Abig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happensto the balance of the funds, which aren't eatenup by the center tax?)"At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supportingdevelopment funds (as they are supporting the developmentwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds tosetup our own testbed, to checkout the electricalpower system architecture. Our testbed has a real lifesolar array field (left over from solar cell researchresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DCswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulatedloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recentchange evaluation involving concerns about the stabilityof the power system.We have also used the supporting development money topurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on lifetesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility inIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells ontest recently hit the four year life test milestone.38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (theon-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis usedthe supporting development funds to purchase personalcomputers and work stations, for performing systemanalyses (like modeling of the performance of theelectrical power system, availability calculationsusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the powersystem elements).Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not allgo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the directordoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal tothe director to get money from this fund to lookat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is ratherdifficult to determine what percentage of theSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To getan accurate figure, you would have to takethe annual expenditure for the library (for example),and then divide by the amount of the library fundsused to support SSF (which would be hard tocompute by itself - how would you figure outwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it onthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-weekversus the rest of the center personnel). You wouldthen have to compare this estimate of the SSFportion of the library expense with the portion ofthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, butwe underpay for snow removal? Talk abouta burecratic nightmareMy last point is that I can't believe your claim thatCongress has never heard of the term 'center tax.'Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony beforeCongress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simpleword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methodswere documented for Congress?

Basically, you look into a room that lookssimilar to the following:                             xxxx                         xxxxx   xxxx                     xxxx    x       xxxx                 xxxx        x           xxxx             xxxx     2      xxxx     1      xxxx             x           xxxx    xxxx           x             x       xxxx            xxxx       x             x   xxxx             o      xxxx   x             xxxx              3 /|\         xxxx                 xxxx            /~\     xxxx                     xxxx            xxxx                         xxxx    xxxx                             xxxxThe good thing about this perspective is that you can look and movearound in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-codedfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slopeof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried thisbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran apacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the "jaggies."  I'mnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distortthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise shearedshape?Currently I take:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64and produce:                         1  2  3  433 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  849 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32                                    61 62 63 64Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  Butit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmapalready skewed?Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears tobe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outsideof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have tochange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that thisapproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enoughdistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object ina real perspective drawing.Hopefully the "context" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torcheshanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.Thanks in advance for any help.-- Till next time,                \o/   \o/                                V \o/ V     email:pinkytamu.edu<>  Sam  Inala  <>                 V

From: buennekemonty.rand.org (Richard Buenneke)Subject: DC-X Rollout ReportX-Added: Forwarded by Space DigestOrganization: [via International Space University]Original-Sender: isuVACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDUDistribution: sciLines: 124McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect SouthernCalifornia day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship lastSaturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technologydemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)rocket ship.        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White SandsMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start inmid-June.        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast forSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid 60million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of afollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required fora sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister governmentagencies.        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs fororbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recentchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTOless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X asa step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,said Col.  Simon "Pete" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Wordendeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for theprogram. "I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money Ihave available to spend," he quipped at a press conference at McDonnellDouglas Astronautics headquarters.        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbitalobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the "better,faster, cheaper" approach to hardware development.  The agency believesthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that "leapfrog" ahead ofevolutionary technology developments.        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a "build a little, test alittle" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He saidthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --showed how today's engineers could move beyond the "miracles of ourparents' time."        "The key is management," Worden said. "SDIO had a very light handon this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable."        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden saidlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will becrucial. "It's essential we do not end up with a large managementstructure where the price goes up exponentially."        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of theHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. "This is the directionwe're going to have to go," said Rep.  George Brown, the committee'sDemocratic chairman. "Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren'tsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has."        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.Joking that "a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if itwere left to the civil space agency.        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnellDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stagedrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. "Let's notbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship"         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said theprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with itsC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautiousabout a large private secotro commitment. "On very large ventures,companies put in seed money," said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'senior vice president for space systems. "You need strong governmentinvestments."        While the government and industry continue to differ on fundingfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach todevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to DouglasAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way forthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry couldeventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will "expand the envelope"of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  Thefirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticletake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000feet.        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The finaltests will include a "pitch-over" manever that rotates the vehicle backinto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles "Pete"Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehiclesaircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automatedcheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology willbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than thePratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds ofthrust        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 modelhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-onthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapidturnaround.        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employtri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff andthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt hasa technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsiblefor the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.

I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all outof town (in NM).As for the future, there is at least 5M in next years budget for workon SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to havesome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbitalprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive foranother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (withmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for aset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers ofthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about 50M nextyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be madefor spending half on DC.Public support is STILL critical.

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. Inthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection pointof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases whichmay make you headache.The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point andall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of thesuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, thenit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.My experience tells the second method is relible.Hope this helps.YehUSC

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years. Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)SATO, T.; INOOKA, Y.; FUKAO, S. (Kyoto Univ., Japan); KATO, S.Kyoto Univ., Uji (Japan). Radio Atmospheric Science Center.In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 pPublication Date: Jun. 1986      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed.Equatorial radar systemFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,Workshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration is presented.

I can't imagine the FAA allowing>people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.>Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an "F" motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.>And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rocketsfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everythingbigger) rocket hobbies.

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which    much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again    unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set    public policy, that's what your representatives are for.    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on    microfilm.    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch    from.    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean    sheet design.    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early    in a mission.    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to    pursue are:    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good    article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch,    "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November    1989 issue of *Ad Astra*. (Both magazines are published by pro-space    organizations, the Planetary Society and the National Space Society    respectively.)

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted    study, Charles Jackman.    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the    total stratospheric chlorine sources.    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons    do at the present time.    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical    Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).    _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.    Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin    team's medical/forensic report.    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit    spacecraft.    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]    THE "FACE ON MARS"    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't    know the address) to study the Face.    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or    sci.astro.    V. DiPeitro and G.

From: renewblade.stack.urc.tue.nl (Rene Walter)Subject: CView answersOrganization: MCGV Stack, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands.Lines: 66NNTP-Posting-Host: blade.stack.urc.tue.nlSummary: some CView problems explainedKeywords: Stupid ProgrammingX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to postit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the mostannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has todo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no controlover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its"current directory".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CViewdoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colourinformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the "dithering", again writinganother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing thissecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it doesthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file toyour screen again.  (It does this last "recopy" operation for its"fit to screen" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.) The result of this process is the following:       1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the        dithering and writes to the screen card.        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which        there was room on the disk.This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the generalidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in detailsabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficientdisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can bevery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excessof 6 Meg free disk space.CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file froma floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on thefloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FATtable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly insertedfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possiblyunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL  It is incredibly poor programming for aprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Filesmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves thehi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at oncewhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take tosort a directory listing?With much thanks to the originator of this article. +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ |        Rene Walter          |          renewstack.urc.tue.nl           | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | "Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           | |  Will this world ever get better, Can't we all just live together       | |  I don't wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              | |  I deserve to have a future..."                                         | |                                     -The Good Girls    "Future"         | +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+

So some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was Wilbur andOrville Wright, and quite a few others.. Sorry if I do not have the big degreesand such, but I think (I might be wrong, to error is human) I have somethingthat is in many ways just as important, I have imagination, dreams. And withoutdreams all the knowledge is worthless.. Sorry my two cents worth. Or is it two rubles worth?The basic quote idea is from H. Beam Pipers book "Space Vikings". Its a goodbook on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights.Unfortunately H. Beam Piper killed him self just weeks short of having hisfirst book published, and have his ideas see light.. Such a waste.

As I understand it, the DC-X derived orbitalvehicle (DC-Y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, notcompletely nose-first.  So why is the DC-Y look symmetric in every drawingI've seen?  I would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like wingless Orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on thetop side.

It was proposed many years ago and involved a ballfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to littleadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them.

It uses few calculations however, basically it is severalcomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after thetransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on thescreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  Mymethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on thescreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back ofsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, somerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you arelooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

From: Wales.Larrisonofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Space Advertising (2 of 2)X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 82   Two developments have brought these type of activities back tothe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed fromthe Mir Space Station.  While this "Banner" reflector was blank,NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Bannerreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TVcommercial, as filmed from the Mir.   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, thesame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestogabooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the "EnvironmentalBillboard".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of theUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the "EnvironmentalBillboard" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible formaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry "ozone readingsensors" to "continuously monitor the condition of the Earth'sdelicate protective ozone layer," according to Mike Lawson, head ofSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimumexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth'satmosphere. According to IMI, "as the biodegradable material burns,it will release ozone-building components that will literallyreplenish the ozone layer." The remaining spacecraft will monitorthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burnsup and "adds to the ozone supply."   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least severalmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMIestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people whowatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is beingpromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996Summer Olympics in Atlanta.  But back to Brian's questions:>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild>idea" stage or does it have real funding?      See above. As for serious -- if they can get 15-20 M or so (myestimate of 5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming totailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times foroptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back uponsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicatedlaunch.  That's a 10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this aswell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the useof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think thelegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional lightpollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legalchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positiveaspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make theadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would changepositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate thespace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend 15 M to look like anidiot?)   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a lowenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it wouldonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and beforedawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible justafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the timeof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might stillbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  Therewere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestogaadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was foronly a 500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious fundingfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around lookingfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But Iam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.     And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please bemy guest.

From: jgreentrumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green)Subject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts.Organization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis ObispoLines: 51Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  Forexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a "safe"mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and ifmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economygets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments"turned off" rather than just "safed".  Was it political (i.e.as along as they could be used, someone would keep buggingcongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them peskyscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but "uncontrolled"spacecraft causes "radio noise."  I find that hard to believethat this could be a problem in a properly designed "safe" mode.This safe mode could be a program routine which causes thespacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission cancontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back tothe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when thespacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could beprepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact isbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.By making the time and signal location generally known, perhapssomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept thedata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft whichcould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going toplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,exiting the solar system, etc).   Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,etc) should consider designing in a "pause" mode in case theirspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion ofthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo couldhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission"drift" phase.So any holes in all this?/~~~(-: James T.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on theRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidanceto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the spacestation.        A low option of 5 billion, a mid-range option of 7 billion and ahigh option of 9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.        Over the next 5 years, 4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,station options above 7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space stationoption of 9 billion would require 2 billion in offsets from the NASAbudget over the next 5 years.        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider.        Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give "full consideration" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal.        Gibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is wellmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which shouldbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation."        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space ScienceCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of RoaldSagdeev.------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy

From: lansddgp.toronto.edu (Robert Lansdale)Subject: Advice sought: Turning font outlines into renderable polygonsOrganization: CSRI, University of TorontoDistribution: naLines: 53I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 orTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan convertedby a 3D scanline renderer. I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years buthave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have theopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to havesome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules toturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handlecomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simplepolygons). For example, in the letter "O" there are two outlines:	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where thetwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a "polygon withholes". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interiorpolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.I do not want to use this simplistic system since:	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for		some fancy fonts).	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoiddecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (asis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidalpolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines intopolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solutionsince it creates excess number of polygons.Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to createbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on thesesubjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.Thanks for any pointers.--> Rob Lansdale-- Robert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project	Internet: lansddgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research InstituteUUCP:   ..uunetdgp.toronto.edulansd University of TorontoBitnet:	  lansddgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA

Recognizing that most of the military requirementsfor launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figureout how many, how often, where to, etc...)Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, Iknow... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craftdesigns.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY whatthe technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that thisportion again funded by the GOV cost about 20 million.And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with theintention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wallstreet, and saying "I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbersthat show %20 ROI, fund me...)Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority thatjust this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospacecompanies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different thingsends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and europeanspirit of initial cooperation.

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the   tanks big enough.Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and atelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ieduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speakingonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They haveextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity.

Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where "correct" is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to "fold over" neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have morecompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider havingevery point interact with every other point....but first read up onlinear solutions to the n-body problem.There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings onsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

We use it toproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our localnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, theimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export thevideo to the Net.We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs foruse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant forcommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B rolldigitizing system on one 5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted asan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the makerof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has beenunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields persecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that somefind distracting.If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands ofdifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've everused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodologyand the user interface.The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about 20,000.For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a qualitythat will satisfy most of your clients.

The standard VGA and EGA outputs are very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  Whilethere is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard toget your hands on and costs quite a bit.	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has anNTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files bymodem and tape them from the NTSC output.

When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    "It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.|(Ron's ed. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".

Background of the problem:	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.	My problem is this :	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,	else it is trivially rejected. 	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 	somewhere for doing this.

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, 3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:	Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (ericheye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC  Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in  "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c.

Teapot ?-----------"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolisnova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshallsequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many  of the more popular image formats.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware).

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of gregvexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-adminmoon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassxtang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-listamber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-requestamber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-listamber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-requestamber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owneramber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That termdenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. Therockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, todistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-madeammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engineswith graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A "D"engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.An "F" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to adoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size "O" areavailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above areshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines ofsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not ascontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocketengines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, whichholds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities(FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association ofRocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involvedin HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, andcompanies will not sell to uncertified individuals.Bottom Line: It's legit.

Basically to make it soexpensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors ortax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income ofthe mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have therenormal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, andother expenses you can owe more than what you made.BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. Andthe only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..

You might have a specific program thatneeds them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.

I remember one note about instrumentedgridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sleddecelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It hadto be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at thatG. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sittingstraight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how badit can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and agood G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as afluid, and high-pressure situations are not new.

Then make your mods. Thenclick on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if youlook carefully.2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual palletteentries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program mustsave out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes itsaves out 8 bit images - of courseXV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handyfacility, not a bug.How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be doneunless the software were very different and much more complicated.If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfullsoftware - which is readily available commercially.And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image ofarbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug.

The conference was organized by the Rensse-          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS          users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond          PHIGS".          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools          based on PHIGS.          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.          PHIGS EVERYWHERE          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to          mainframes.          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing          and translucency.          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.          Radiosity support is also planned.          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful          "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or          Starbase.          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS          or ARENA is available on request.          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-          porates PEX support.          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340          workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.          Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A          Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics          PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-          ments.          PHIGS USER GROUP          The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS          applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and          PHIGS standards bodies.

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's lessthan eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrainand reschedule the EVA's in that time.More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything itwas going to do execpt fire the OMS.  In addition, you've added significantextra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there areonly two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST andAXAF.  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle,there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    "Find a way or make one."	             -attributed to Hannibal

Replacement components(WFPC II, COSTAR, gyros, solar panels, and probably a few others), all sorts oftools, EVA equipment, and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can.  Thisshould be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved thehighest altitude for a shuttle mission to date.  And HST is now in a lower orbit.

I was alsoshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills byabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  Whatis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, duemainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but ismore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end atdifferent x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in thestitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygonright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely seea smeared effect where they overlap.  Example:  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick whenrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaceswith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, asyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, thesystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so theapplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.Bravo(Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosedthrough proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)--   Mark Einkauf     [ einkaufaustin.ibm.com ]  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems  Austin TX * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *

Thanks.I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains todeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.	Graeme Gill."A note on gamma correction and images"Author: Graeme W. Gill        graemelabtam.oz.auDate: 93/5/16"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?"--------------------------------------Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image",there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch ofdifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a wholelot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bitcomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloadedimages from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most imageviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and somelook too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction(or the lack of it).Why do we need gamma correction at all ?--------------------------------------Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathoderay tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If youhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computerimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point ofthe scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-correctedimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulatethe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. addingand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltageand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give youan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of lightcoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltagesomething like this:Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gammaSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the imagewill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct"the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRTwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you getwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?-----------------------------------------------------The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video camerasor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of imagesalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those imageswith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image getscorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of thoseimages with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it willlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction isnot exactly right for you particular CRT.Whose fault is all this ?-----------------------It is really three things. One is all those display programsout there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another isthat most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, ordon't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.The third thing is that not many people understand what gammacorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varyinggamma's.At least two file formats do the right thing.The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recordingthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. alinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor youare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying toview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) andutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gammaof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correctionyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying thegamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to theappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensityin the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails totake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tendsto give a tint to the image. ]How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?---------------------------------------------------------------------The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format filecontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linearto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other usingdithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma correctsimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the pointat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly halfway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps ifyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes abit.)If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will havea long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightnesswill be above the center.If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correctionfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase thegamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually bearound 2.2 [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMAenvironment variable in your .profile]How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?-------------------------------------------------This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot oftrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gammacorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma correctedto some degree or other.If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images willlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images willlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing-----------------------------------------------------One of the reason that many high quality formats (such asVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes betteruse of the storage medium. This is because the humaneye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correctionhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is thatevery time you want to do any image processing you shouldconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retainthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, andnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standardgamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma correctedimages at the popular level.If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,and if image manipulation software takes care to useextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has astandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get thehighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

Given that Iam not an astrophysicist  or nuclear physicist,  i'll have to boil itdown a bit.1)  ALl the data on bursts to date,  shows a smooth random distribution.2)  that means they aren't concentrated in  galactic cores, our or someoneelses.3) If the distribution is smooth,  we are either seeing some  ENORMOUSLYlarge phenomena  scattered at the edge of the universe  said phenomenabeing subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena	ORwe are seeing some phenomena  out at like the Oort cloud,  but then it needssome potent little energy source,  that isn't detectable  by any othercurrent methods.4)  we know it's not real close,  like  slightly extra solar,  becausewe have no parallax measurements on the bursts.5)  the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta orsuper string  impacts or something like that.So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile.what i am wondering,  is this in people's opinion,  A NEW Physics problem.Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect.

Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to adistance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacingand t the time resolution.

The whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around thedefinition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well andgood, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someonerepresenting you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government orthe church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, andthen enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitutionprovides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights areconsidered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries havecomparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a rightto a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in theU.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.

Hathaway The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the missionwas planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there wasenormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THeyhave now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserveEVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaperbetter,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendablespace manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.pat

I think thetail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the caseof the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance ratherthan locomotion. I don't know much about panda "thumbs", so I'll askis it opposable?>>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would>>seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range>>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens>>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant.>>Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent?>>[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by>putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far>space aliens are also mythical.]Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'llbring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why Idon't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say "intelligent"I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a levelwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assumingsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly nota universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will sufficefor a putative technological alien.Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, butit's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain levelof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuroncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemurwouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argumentis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's roomfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. Onereason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficultfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of verylarge creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule outintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like thelemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidlylost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creaturethat must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the timeto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemicalreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures wouldtend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near thatof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold bloodedcreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend thatsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creaturethe size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrainedor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from thewaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to theocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligenceto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with theenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaurwould be capable of that much activity.Gary-- Gary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatechwa4meike4zvgaryDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunetrsiatlke4zvgary534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed      | emorykd4ncke4zvgary Lawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     |

What i want to do isthe following;From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each havingit's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given thelisteners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of thelisteners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  Thismeans that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it'sincoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this ispossible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several anglesrelative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a givenangle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from thesource.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound sourcechanges position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally somereflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is definedcould be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandationsimulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?

The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them   at cosmological distances;   but as long as there is no distance   indicator to these events all possible sources which are   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs   originate in the solar cometary cloud   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE   catalogue up to March, 1992), and   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,   at least to some extent, true variations   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the \vov   test to both distributions.   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a   \chi^2 test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds \sim 800   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.   Currently,    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement   found for the \vov parameter which makes the Oort   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes wereperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to groundstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for theMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via thespacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed topreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being asource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle wasperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition oftwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of thespacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded backto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated theantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  TheRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and hadincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence wasuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator onMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn theTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew testmini-sequence.7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft understored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degreesfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All ofthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature wasat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-timecommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 203 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) tookplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test wentwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test wassuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 withDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System DevelopmentOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of currentProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-goingcruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past monthsaccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significantschedule changes or significant problems were reported.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC1.

Many different observations, including IRAS> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures> can range from 40K to 150K.Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The "large"grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light withfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of thethermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiatingefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at longwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiatethe energy they have absorbed.Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longerwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  Inthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectableby any conceivable observation.Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by apopulation of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up totemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they coolquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a smallpopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed"average" temperature.A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data hasthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacaldust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  Atthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors arerespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughlydoubled in the ecliptic plane.To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilutionfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, thentake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes fromAllen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalentto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful workcould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had adilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would becooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density ofstarlight comes out about the same as that of the microwavebackground, and I believe that to be correct.)                         Dilution   Temp.

I have read a few articles about this and knowthat two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Bothideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there existspublic domain source code for this.    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-castingwhich is reported to be more or less independent of number of facesconsisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversionusing a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have theirnormal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure theirnormals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumedthis is already the case.   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hiddenline removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointingtoward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to makesure ?   Any pointers are welcome ?

I have had>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help? Certainly. Reference follows. Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be calledred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or majordysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to longwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination andalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although itcan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computergraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colourdeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from thispoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far redcorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightlydifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimentalsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and oneaffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder ontowhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm onthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line isvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia orduuteranopia:1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line4) This is the new chromaticity. The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colourdefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics andApplications 8(5) 28-40.You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are notfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficultYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the redgreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, andthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, orobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities acouple of weeks ago.The procedure, for each pixel () is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be ahelp here.)A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once youhave the monitor data.B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 aboveD) find the intersection as in step 3E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step AF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move italong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black andwhite) until it is displayable.>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is>sufficient interestDone; also posted for the rest of us.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a pieceof a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get theoutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneouslysuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  Isuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastlinevery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The mostcommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel andtangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead ofthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactivealgorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going thewrong way".	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did hisdoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitizedmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve withits auto-trace tool.	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since hewas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding agood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all futureanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problemsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what thevirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could berestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing reallife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficultthis problem is to solve in the general case.	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared whileon vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their lastknown location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.

Although initiallyenormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive thenaspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wideclass of infections.Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promisedamazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing anddevelopement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 timesof administration  and costs 2,000 per administrationwith no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.The drug thus costs 10,000 per useful case,  and isimplicated in a slight increase in mortality for somepatients.I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin,but to centoxin.pat

The problems you present are exist anyway,and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make suchproblems to my programs in the first place.Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit imageas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized imageback to 24 bit image.>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and>>>much more complicated.Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bitand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,jumps off the discussion a bit.My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bitimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:changing individual colors in colormap is useless in mostcases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change maymake serious errors to anywhere in the image.XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with thementioned type images.Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those globalchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds likepaint program job.If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get theoriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bitimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible tomodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (ifimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --selecting individual color is possible from that.Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seensuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention24bit painting program in 8bit screen...>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is notdesigned for that.Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it isexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designedwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect theprogram work -- design error.I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, butit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without makingmajor change to the original design.So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and savedimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goesup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.(Americans: the lift is just an example :)Well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded toread it.Juhana Kouhia

Teapot ?-----------"Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the wholestory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also hasthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframemodel of the teapot.IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describesan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations forexample are used.The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to getthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolisnova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it"  "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of gregvexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-adminmoon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new "canonical" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassxtang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-listamber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-requestamber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-listamber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-requestamber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owneramber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI  database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from  a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default  directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different  "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to  contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI "database").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"  in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set thatwe did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts areusually more complex than this example I will use here.        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a durationof 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of thetime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for severaldifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of thegalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at aR=8800Mpc.          We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used theold standby formula:                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Prettyenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd callmoderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out thatmuch energy in one second?                                                 -jeremy

Big difference.   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the rightenergy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlationwith galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for gettingall the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount ofbaryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes aplasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generatingenough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), ithappens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard tomake tight-binaries of neutron stars.Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of aneutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, butthat uses pretty far-out physics.My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, soGRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can'trule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event whichconverts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial blackholes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter cometsaren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism whichmodifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of thesemechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the "Tunguska Meteorite"was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likelyto be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-cometcollisions matches the GRB rate well.The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oortcloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule themout.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got theright distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossibleto match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got thewrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-cloud GRB's at all.Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oortcloud.

From: gorgenann-arbor.applicon.slb.com (David Gorgen)Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas togetherOrganization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areasLines: 84I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably lowapparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 differentPEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in anyresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually thesame article with a test program demonstrating the problem oncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs andare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program incomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approachto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the aboveGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching"artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that arecoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line willdiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z valuesacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident withvertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether theZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though theline is supposed to be solid.Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightlydifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, onefor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always ineffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  Theresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as toattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes usedin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e.smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the viewtable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformedto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line thanif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amountto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRCbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fixthe stitching.But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Zcomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears moreor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of theZ-buffer have any dependable meaning  This amount is so great that oneproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through"areas which they are supposed to lie behind.I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digitalworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The testprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX5.1.Open questions:    (1) Why does this happen?        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which            could be corrected for?        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their            interpolators?        --  Something else?    (2) What to do about it?        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision            in Z-buffered HLHSR?        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching            artifacts?        --  Am I just out of luck?Any help would be immensely appreciated-- ===============================================================================Dave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgenann-arbor.applicon.slb.comApplicon Inc.                                 gorgenaaaca1.sinet.slb.comAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...uunetsharkeyapplgagorgen

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST'sorbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highestpossible Shuttle orbit. Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extendedduration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cellsand RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life supportre-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)and Orbiter Duration.   In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engineswill be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavything.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuelneeded to fly both up is substantial.   a small boostercarried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantlyless then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,for a given orbital change.

People seem perfectly capable	dealing with these others.  Dealing with the format of TIFF	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT, LZW, and	FAX encoding of the image data.  The majority of the libraries	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about	using it in many instances.  GIF is very nice for use in low-end	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially	viable file formats.	If we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length	encoding.

From: hathawaystsci.eduSubject: Re: Vandalizing the sky.Lines: 81Organization: Space Telescope Science InstituteDistribution: na>Newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space>Subject: Re: Vandalizing the sky.>My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO inalienable rights damn it  The majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a lastbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD (P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome, just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)

Of course the chances ofOk It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few important parameters. The polygons are all convex. They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convexpolygons can be much more efficient than those that can drawconcave / self intersecting polygons. This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking forcode that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convexpolygons.  >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source>with it.

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the application.  It may let you- manipulate application data, the camera,  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or- view the status of the application or 3-D objects  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as apartially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The lengthof the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on theruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation andfeedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance betweenthe objects along its own axis.Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The informationI gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.Your help is very much appreciated.Tony Lau<tlaucs.ubc.ca>M.Sc. StudentDept. of Computer Science

Especially given the Net'sstrong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                 ==================================                         The Dream Machines:An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                            By Ron Miller                  with Foreword by Arthur C. ClarkeKrieger Publishing CompanyMelbourne, Florida, USAOrig. Ed. 1993Pre-publication 84.50ISBN 0-89464-039-9This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and atechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing thespace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in thetlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot makesuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realizedthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted toreach them.   Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history oftechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travelbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developedthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for thatmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reasonas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accuratereflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, andknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, aswell as selected events important in developing the idea ofextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronologicalentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events andspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons betweensimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They revealconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Everyentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly everyspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  Thisallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualizedifferences, similarities, and influences.This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematicdiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs andhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  Theunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive andvery interesting history of the spaceship.SPECIAL FEATURESIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real andfictionalContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photoscontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rareillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos anddrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous andobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASAarchivesAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.CONTENTSPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)Part II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)Part III The Experimenters (1900-1938)Part IV The World War (1939-1945)Part V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)Part VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)ABOUT RON MILLER[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the highspots.]Former art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian'sNational Air and Space MuseumMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member ofInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the BritishInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & SpaceSmithsonian* magazineAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, andmany others, as well as many articles and papersBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers Contributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*Production illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*Designer of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps forU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)ORDERING INFORMATIONPre-publication price 84.50 before 1 May 1993Afterwards, price will be 112.50Krieger Publishing CompanyPO Box 9542Melbourne, FL 32902-9542USADirect order line (407)727-7270Fax (407)951-3671Add 5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, 1.50 for eachadditional book.

IMHO the wider meaning is not:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to:  be  [....]:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, darkrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the viewgiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who considerthemselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions arearranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see     {hacker ethic, the}).     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and     facilitating access to information and to computing resources     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}     project.     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})     can function without central control because of this trait; they     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who: says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describinglimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is betternot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessaryto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around theworkplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-knownand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)Language works anyway that we want it to work.

Here's what you should do.Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices intothe array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for eachvertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertexmore than once; you also do backface elimination before processing thepolygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't haveto be transformed at all.Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hitherplane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have theirprojection done at that stage.-- 	Bernie Roehl        University of Waterloo Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering	Mail: broehlsunee.UWaterloo.ca	Voice:  (519) 885-1211 x 2607 [work]

(Sorry, I don't remember the name of the node offhand, 	although it's .mit.edu.)

Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role ofsupporting research which private industry finds too expensive or toolong-term.  (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it becauseof socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries tocompete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov'thas taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involveitself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces shoulddrive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  Butthe whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, orsome countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  Sothe U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds alot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,doesn't it?)But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical tocost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on newtechnology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterlyearnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest innew technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes littlesense to try to save money.Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODYdisagrees about that the wisdom should be.  It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost controlavailable in industry today were derived from Government projects.GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comesfrom DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industryhas taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every largeconstruction project now uses these tools.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368     "A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one.

Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years.      My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)     This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the situation.     (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on thenet about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta havethis replaced and it's gonna cost you ???."I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable lifecycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: thebrand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX  20 MHz.I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it downbefore coming in to work today.If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm notopposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutelynecessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mikemik.uky.edubut if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feelfree to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location andname of the FAQ if you don't mind.Thanks in advance for any help...-Mike Mattone(mikemik.uky.edu)

I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talkabout it; I shall.I feel that we as a community of people have unique resourcesto deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborateon the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understandsthe impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absenceof such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not onlycommunicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life sciencevariables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like longexpenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educationalto the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technicaljournals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,ideas for further research and development could be put forward forthe general public to ponder...allowing the general public to takepart in the excitement of exploration.Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per weekto running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the hallsof NASA and industry.I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personallyeager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regardinghow best to grade the viability of various technologies for applicationto spaceflight.ken

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS                                     PART 3                       Copyright (c) 1993 by Larry Klaes	The author gives permission to any group or individual wishing	to distribute this article, so long as proper credit is given,        the author is notified, and the article is reproduced in its         entirety.        To the North Pole        On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON     rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan     Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe     for the planet Venus.         Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger     to properly transmit this information to Earth.         Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by     the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles).         The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects     no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations     made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the     island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or     PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially     interesting geological features worthy of investigation.        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330     million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections,     VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a     polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around     the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA     16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus'     first polar-circling spacecraft.        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20     for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers     (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.      The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over     the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back     to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took     eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions     in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers     (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills,     mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape,     many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the     last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean     surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the     largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids     would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles)     across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes'     owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the     summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest     mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American     scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell     was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.          In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be     called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan     (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even     finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet     probes maintained that distinction.        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the     Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating     current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds     over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles)     lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty     kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees     warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were     plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at     more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to     pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control    gas to perform the operation.          VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving     the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six     hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an     atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.        Venus by Balloon        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting     target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of     air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of     the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint     French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless,     late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21,     the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full     views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe     since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft     have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one     celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.          This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to     the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists     around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such     bodies which actually come close to Earth.          Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar     system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall     in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice     and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar     encounter.        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the     comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and     SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance.         Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of     data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter     and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor     John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an     advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of     the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the     U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier.     The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the     location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive     in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had    successfully arrived.         One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which    permeated the planet's atmosphere.         The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag     would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened     hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.      This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as     well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.      The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar     to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists     had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight     due to the permanently thick cloud cover.        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.         Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13     and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to     accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6     miles) above the surface.         There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never     before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature     and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees     Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's     56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background     infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and     12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine,     and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active     volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks     appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers     instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were     three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50     and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles),     much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air     over the last seven years.        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last     functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the     dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial    bodies with one space vessel.        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent     for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite     Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5     miles) towards the surface.        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air     layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius     (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed     through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer     failed to function.        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite,     rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in     aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree     of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured     463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin     to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030     kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet     is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers     (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three     hours.        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the     probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance     of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets     had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly     a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was     not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.      VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.        Future Plans Diverted        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous     ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second     world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for    the early 1990s.        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple     probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft     would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon     probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's     corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over     the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to     investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible     landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main     Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space     program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction     was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this     class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next     year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on    Mars' largest moon, Phobos.         All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and     eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious    consideration of human colonization in the near future.        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon    landing in March of 1989.         In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put     on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of    continuous robotic exploration of the planet.         During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began     to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with     the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the     culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking     a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to     make money.          In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for     sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price     of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary     probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United     States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.        MAGELLAN and GALILEO         The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most     detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space     Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit     the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle     ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space,     named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the     probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in    that violent atmosphere.        On the Drawing Boards        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet     Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1,     1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions     within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects     as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.        Humans on Venus              Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide     atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability     to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries    if not millennia.        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found    through international cooperation, including the nation which     made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

I have a question regarding satellite technology seenin the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes itsorbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa.The photos taken by the sats are stunning  I know that sats arecapable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  Myquestion is this:  The camp in question was taken out by theBritish SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team waswatching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SASwas clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was atnight and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.Does such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR,x-ray, etc.PS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games?Mad Vlad

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are buildingKeck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, "Thissecond 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescopewith double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolvethe headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away."   Japan's 8.3-meterSubaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopeswill work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopesAnd haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of researchwas done with "Star Wars" funding, and some is now being shared withastronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a fewyears, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.To say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is pure hokum.  To use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn'tmatter if it gets worse is absurd.

You assumethat the general public "can't handle the truth" and then, based on this assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand agood argument, comes along and asks "why don't you just develop the spinoffs?"or "why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like themilitary?"  There are some good arguments for space development without relyingon its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply thinkthat the general public deserves more credit than you give them.>BTW: don't forget Velcro...And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took thetrouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties.  I would need to see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be heretoday without NASA.-- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289uxa.cso.uiuc.edu		    "Find a way or make one."	             -attributed to Hannibal

This will be a follow on to oursuccesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight ofSEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumentedpayload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the westcoast of Mexico.  This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.We want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this asquickly and inexpensively as possible.  We want to be able to track thepayload after it has deployed its parachute.  An idea we have is to put thesame kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and RescueSatellites).  It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid intracking.  These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs(Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon).  They are rugged (they have tobe to survive a ship wreck) and cheap.  We have several questions:1.  What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons.  Arethere multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?2.  What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals.  Can theybe used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning therelevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threateningemergencies?3.  What is the coverage of SARSATS?  Are they in LEO with only intermittantcoverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronousorbit?4.

Some wonder whether or not the moon couldhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing whatour geology/environmental sciences friends think.As for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in termsof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at highaltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown byhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude onMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peakwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, becauseif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probablypass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. Sothis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would belimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higherpressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations andcould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting thebends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres ofpressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't infront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomestoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogennarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, liketaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feetunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as Iam not a diving expert).Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphereis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?kenkhayashhsc.usc.edu

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results   (for better or for worse).   I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default   "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten   frames.   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with   "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task   switching.   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance   even more...

Image sizeis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can alsomake a real difference.Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...-Peter Lee --/-------------------- Peter E.

From: exjob-17dali.NoSubdomain.NoDomain (Niclas Mattsson)Subject: WANTED: Grayscale dithering routineNntp-Posting-Host: dali.math.chalmers.seOrganization: Chalmers University of TechnologyLines: 15I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smallersize using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 graysintroduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminatedby dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now Iwould like to automate the procedure.The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and theobvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close toXV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the imagesare in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural imagecolors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in thepublic domain? If so, where?  -- Niclas Mattssonexjob-17math.chalmers.se
From: thomsonalcpva.saic.comSubject: Space surveillance: what I really meantOrganization: Science Applications Int'l Corp./San DiegoLines: 33      Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance. Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, rather than space surveillance      What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance).     The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing.     Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be that other countries do also.     Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do it, and why do they do it?Allen Thomson                     SAIC                        McLean, VA-------------------------------------------------------------------------Oh, yes: I don't speak for SAIC.

Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking "If I put a blackbodyin interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambientradiation field?"   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-farfrom being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRASand COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperaturescan range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings"Interstellar Processes", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr.,published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and Black.   Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bitfrom place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association,I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so varied.

Hacking iswhat AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources thatnot many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producingrunning programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches toproblem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)--Peter Jackson, Dept of Electrical & Computer Eng, Clarkson University"Opinions expressed are not those of my employer or any other organization"Second Violin, Fiddling Firefighters Ensemble (Rome Branch)

From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume itwas tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, saythe linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.

I have noticedmy and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge   2) one's financial situation takes precedence   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"or the biggest killer (IMO)   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without      the motivation the effort seems useless.Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us rememberwhen there were several completely different computer systems, our childrenare growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoythe diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the earlyeighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systemsthat were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widelydivergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn newsystems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program wasneeded we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as acommercial offering was just not available.

"mothership" exceptfor Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a"Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt thatthe idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rathersmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak TitanIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot incommon with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending aprobe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying severalsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towardsJupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerfulcameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful powersource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurementswithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at arelatively great distance.---The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers,and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto inthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points duringthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out thesame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but inaddition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examiningthat planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would haveenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and severalother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptunesystems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due totrajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature spaceprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outerplanets The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, ofcourse.

Doubtless it will fail to meet some ofthe promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it'sthe *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindlingaway, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock anyzeroes off that 2000-3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame forthis must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annualbillions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you willno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keepingdevelopment costs low and flying incremental "X-plane" hardware.It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built acomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I wouldhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990sAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, orbuilding the DC-Y.I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for anyexpansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect forbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  Ifthe DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties andthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, aprospect too depressing to bear.(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a differentdirection.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbitallaunch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market forsmall payloads.)I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There areplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, someof them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today'sworld that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near anassembly line.>You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following:[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]>3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable>DC-X successorStrawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, whichincludes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttleoperations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your commonsense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside theShuttle, not instead of it.Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be usefulfor a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.>4  Most importantly, that the DC-X will open up LEO to more scientific and>technical payloads.If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for 1M, or even 5M,rather than the 40M it now costs, more people will be able to affordmore payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellitesinstead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Littleoutfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead ofbegging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.

From: rwastro.Princeton.EDU (Ralph A.M.J. Wijers)Subject: Re: Gamma Ray Bursters. WHere are they.Originator: newsnimasterNntp-Posting-Host: astro.princeton.eduOrganization: Princeton UniversityLines: 51I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observationsrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts isutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it toBATSE press releases.The idea behind the statement is as follows:      "if you smack two neutron      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy       is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must      be wrong."As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person whowas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. Itmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-rayburst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is createdmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which maycarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. Allthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best onearound (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternativeproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in whicha very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a blackhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matterwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugalforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto theblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of suchevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rateof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the twoscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot lessin the failed supernova scenario.On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical methodsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,or finding a definitive signature of some known class ofobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theoristshave historically not been too successfull in finding thedistance of any object by proving that there is only onepossible way in which the object can work, and thereforeit *must* be so-and-so.Ralph Wijers

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility thatthey would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but onethat was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime wasas short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upperenvelope of what the Shuttle can do.I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, inaddition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down and take it up again.Ben

The other xthree instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, forman image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether differentbeast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errorsand errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors haveany independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used todetermine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error.  Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together now: "Parallax ARc SECond", a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information andwatches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combinationwhen you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.-Kevin

From: David.Andermanofa123.fidonet.orgSubject: Update - Back to the Moon billX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993Lines: 51          Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:                          The Next Step                                  The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  manycongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the bestpossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to hisposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a longrecord of support and interest in space development, and helpedpass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space SettlementsAct.                              There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brownabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-spaceconstituents to let him know that they care about gettingAmerica back to the Moon.        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have himintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during latespring, 1993.        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown'soffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.        However, even if we are successful in getting him to supportthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. Forany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:either the bill must reflect widespread national support for anissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); bepropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); orhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, butwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,by necessity, must choose.                            This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large numberof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplishthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to supportthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until thebill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have acongressperson's staff review a bill.        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yetintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currentlywritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activistsand politicians.        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, pleaserequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal serviceaddress), or contact your local chapter of the National SpaceSociety).--- Maximus 2.01wb

Even though this device is really only good for the brightestobjects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeterin the telescope's focal plane."

Computer  graphics has played  adecisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists tobuild, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects. While computer scientists are conversant in the language of theirown discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigmsand technological advances in graphical computing. This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gapbetween computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistryresearchers who wish to be more than just casual users ofprepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended tobe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data setsfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and studentswill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercisesand projects will be carried out using data-flow programming(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will haveaccess to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including videorecording equipment. Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of           scientific visualization.            The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a           first-come first-served basis. Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,           X-windows and C is useful but not required. Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits) Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm Cost:   0 or 1 credit       410        2 credits           820 Format The course will be held in the Theory Center training facilitywhere computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will beinterspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be providedfor project enablement and familiarization with the new computingenvironment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basisof their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolledfor a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be givenmore time for project development and meet daily to share experienceand discuss problems encountered. Content (may vary)     Elements of computer graphics         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow         programming (DX), interactivity.

From: richmondspiff.Princeton.EDU (Stupendous Man)Subject: Interstellar T _is_ 3-4K; notes on Pluto/Charon talk and Pluto MissionOriginator: newsnimasterKeywords: I goofedNntp-Posting-Host: spiff.princeton.eduOrganization: Princeton UniversityLines: 73   (sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said "Dust grainsacts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K."  Well, I was deadwrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, hasinformed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation fieldfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me totake another ISM class :-(  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gavea talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a briefoverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio ofabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and thengave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outersolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most gotscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiterand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especiallyUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage throughNeptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking].  He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects,1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from thelarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some materialinto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar toideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidencefrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidencefor the impact theory.  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objectsremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first membersof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodieswill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbonsby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it formsbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are goingto be very hard to see.  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you seea howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flybymission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use aTitan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory"to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd liketo use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costsMUCH less.  His figures: 500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (therewill be two separate probes, launched separately), or 120 Millionfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originallyoffered to sell Proton launches for 30 Million each, but were forcedto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in themarketplace.  I'm just telling you what he said.

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere> evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet.  The question> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understandingof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth'satmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naiveanswer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesisby itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen producedis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is neededis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction ofthe resulting reduced material.On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organicmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requirescontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slowthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet withoutcontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulatingan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have ahard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmospherehas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 toweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedbackmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weakanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygenlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering aboutit.	Paul F.

As far as commercialization, that is>a long ways off.  ...> Anybody know anything further? Is this really news? Does this>threaten further work on DC-? ?     Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carriedout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for sometime.  A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of PropulsionOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paperdescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieveaircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problemsassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speedairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane   The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in thepaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons andlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjetsand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavypayload on an expendable second stage.   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like anormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swingout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land likeaircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoffis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbsof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrustrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX wouldbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design'ssuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compacttankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They concludewhile a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greatersafety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handleand bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its majoruse of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provideas close to airline-like operations as possible with a practicalconfiguration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept canbe shown to be operationally viable."  >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs forsome time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHLSSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-goingstudies trying straighten out the government's future spacetransportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There arevarious factions and options vying for attention -- includingshuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3"architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advancedvehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategyfor future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying tojuggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) againstmedium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and againstthe investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologieslike SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn'tthat there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozensof them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs inthe near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with afinal report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor  --- Maximus 2.01wb
From: mcelwrecnsvax.uwec.eduSubject: "The Universe of MOTION" (book review)Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau ClaireLines: 141                              (Book Review):                              "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North           Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed,           hardcover.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to           most ALL astrophysical mysteries.                          This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged           edition of "THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE", 1959.            Volume I is "NOTHING BUT MOTION" (1979), and Volume II is           "THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER" (1988).                          Most books and journal articles on the subject of           astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial           differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by           contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except           for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.            Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical           agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual           validity.                          Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor           of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State           University.  He developed the Theory described in his books           while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the           properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements           they contain.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" describes the astrophysical           portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE,           GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of           "grand unified field theory" that orthodox physicists and           astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two           postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of           space and time:                          (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE           component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE           units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME.                          (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of           ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are           ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.                          From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a           COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic           particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the           concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with           translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was           able to match parts of his theoretical universe with           corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including           EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959           book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES,           several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They           are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And           when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation           ready for those also.                          As a result of his theory, which he called "THE           RECIPROCAL SYSTEM", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the           sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists,           including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter,           quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure),           "nuclear" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass           increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in           stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be           nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very           critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles,           solutions in principle, "no other way" declarations, etc.,           used to maintain them.                          "THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION" is divided into 31 chapters.            It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from           the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters,           which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that           accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in           from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy           formation from the MYTHICAL "big bang" is a big mystery to           orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life           cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and           solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of           SINGLE stars.                          Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according           to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have           been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies           and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT           (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME).                          Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against           observations that contradict their theories would find           Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an           OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY           BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the           plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray           telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from           ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any           visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional           coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray           bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER           HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the "cosmic           sector".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a           RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed           of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE           dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the           bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly           at random.                          Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from           books, journal articles, and leading physicists and           astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted           with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the           end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book           "Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey", by William K. Hartmann,           says, "Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if           we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars           form.... Unfortunately we cannot."  Larson's book contains           LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are           WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists,           astronomers, and astrophysicists.

WHen aparticularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors thatcatch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  Thispuppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the hugeannulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle givenby BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.          Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talkingthe other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites.

In addition, the power will comefrom a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft willbe about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will bestrong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in thebackground, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is lookingin to it.-- 		David M.

From: gamesmax.u.washington.eduSubject: Words from the Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuffArticle-I.D.: max.1993Apr27.124850.1Distribution: worldLines: 57NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu  Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorterthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a bigpresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much morebare-bones.In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors wouldhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed itin.After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer writtenquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that onlyhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my questionbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made allthe difference.So, on to the substance. The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, suchas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing competewith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developedby Mcdonnell Douglass?Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, lastpart first.This is to the best of my recollection what he said.As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a betteranswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The Highspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes atthis point.So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercialarena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for themto persue work on their own.Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that thisguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for spacelifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is wherethe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairmanof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they aretrying to do something with it.  Anybody know anything further?Is this really news?Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?                    John.
From: Cohenssdgwy.mdc.com (Andy Cohen)Subject: Report on redesign teamOrganization: MDA-WLines: 172Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: q5022531.mdc.comThe following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,based on information provided by NASA headquarters.The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to theAdvisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  Theday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topicscovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement forthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; theassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on managementoptions and operations concepts also were held.The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:� Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priestsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and hasidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tendedand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability neededto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievablecapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplifiedFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existingsystems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab.The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedomphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelabmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and dockingports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiterdocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Differentoperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.� Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of OptionB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to PermanentHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally PermanentHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to thebaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Trackingsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the DataManagement System.Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degreeinclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended durationorbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaicarrays providing 18.75 kW of power.Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add trusssegments and the U.S. lab.Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with twoorbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the othersection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control andpropulsion systems.The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Completestate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would completethe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardwarewould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derivedoption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas includingprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization andoperations costs, he said.� Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solidrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttlemain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launchand jettisoned after ET separation.The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by acentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at variousplaces on the circumference of the module to place the internationalmodules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaicarrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interialattitude.In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connorsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 sothat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with theRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian spaceexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by membersof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian SpaceAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, theMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian teambriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, dockingsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and theSoyuz TM spacecraft.The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilitiesof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russiancapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They willbe available to the SRT through May 5.Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRTsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working todevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build afoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Variousmanagement options have been developed including:� Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain ofcommand.� Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an AssociateAdministrator.� Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-locatedhand-picked program office.� Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming anelement of the current program.� Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts andgeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of theOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which hadalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in itspreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agencyexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas ofassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testingand ground operations.What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide acomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Mondayand Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin thedetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparingfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, tobe held May 3.Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of theStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over theactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistantdeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serveas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available toconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a requestfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently beingcarried on the schedule are:April 26Design Freeze on Options for CostingApril 27Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRTMay 3Status report to Redesign Advisory CommitteeMay 15Interim report by Redesign Advisory CommitteeJune 7Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)

By the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon.

[Some kinds might work better that others.]               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight                    and number.               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                    for three or four weeks.               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of                    the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                    SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                    mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the                    sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier                    mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen,                    hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]                         BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our           own bodies.                          Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with           carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED           HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much           faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).                           Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen,           oxygen, hydrogen, etc..                          The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,           cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..                           The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,           creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators           and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

Subject: ROCKET LAUNCH OBSERVEDFrom: leo.wikholmcompart.fi (Leo Wikholm)Distribution: worldOrganization: ComPart BBS, Helsinki-Finland, +358 0 506 3329 (20 lines V.32bis)Lines: 44    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were    visible till morning sunrise.    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we    have observed 17 satellite launches.

Fungialso radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)(2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)(3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium numberof species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit thisin the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) thatdiversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctionshappen often enough to keep the total number down.(***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmentedspecific ecosystems were. See Cowen's book "History of Life" for a not-too-technicalrun-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.Or see, Wilson's "Diversity of Life" for a view centered moreon current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biologybook of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time. >							James NicollFollow-ups to t.o.Chris Colby 	---	 email: colbybu-bio.bu.edu	---"'My boy,' he said, 'you are descended from a long line of determined,resourceful, microscopic tadpoles--champions every one.'" 	--Kurt Vonnegut from "Galapagos"

In short,an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard onthe Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why thereare laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollutioncomplaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be againstorbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complainon the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they aremore like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beercan somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash._____________Dale M.

From: Matjaz.GamsIJS.siSubject: ``Call for Papers for INFORMATIKA'' Vol. 17 No. 2Originator: abrodnikwatdragon.uwaterloo.caOrganization: Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, SloveniaLines: 69This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.The first fully international issue has been published and echoes are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gamsijs.si). Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structuredin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the editedpart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan forknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned togive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of thejournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own viewsinto the discourse.   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This pageexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problemswithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into otherconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write thispage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to getsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to expresstheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of thearea in question.   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation onone side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in whicheditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story shouldbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to havea stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particularnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situationright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or yourcolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to thecontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which freshideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annualreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishingin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even completepapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We receivedseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typedtexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contactperson (matjaz.gamsijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerningour common interest and job.At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help inevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open variouspossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to giveproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mailand by other means.Sincerely yours,Anton P. "ZeleznikarEditor-in-chief

You mention the age-old desire tosomehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievmentof that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impededby the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-besky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of effortsthat others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon allof the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reachthat goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totallyunreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsernsculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,just because it has changed the way we strive.BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.

The problem is understanding the basicchemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer themefficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is fromplants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we haveto orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologiesbring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similarinteractions.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display==========================================================PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)======================IMDISP------  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions  [PC and Macs]LabVIEW 2---------  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the  "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual  instrument.  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has  utility functions for memory management data communications and  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for  the development of custom code.)Ultimage Concept VI-------------------  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and  characterization.  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can  be imported.  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom  modules.  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even  hole filling.  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road 100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494  707-579-1733IPLab Spectrum--------------  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a  movie command for cycling through windows.Macintosh-based tools=====================NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more---------------------------------  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been  developed by Spyglass.

It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)PhotoMac--------  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700PhotoPress----------  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973PixelTools and TCL-Image------------------------  "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112Adobe Photoshop---------------  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA  94039-7900 415-961-4400ColorStudio and ImageStudio---------------------------  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a  variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close  hues, color range and mask.ImageStudio: Don't know...

One such feature allows the user to  select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide  selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109Image Analyst-------------  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in  radiographs.  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or  a disk-stored image.  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

Contact: aipsmailnrao.edu  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and  can do image arithmetic, etc.    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.     There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and  Australia to name a few. LABOimage---------  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis),   medicine, biology, physics.

Feature Description  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of  modules.  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and  ratioing.  Host Configuration Requirements  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific  applications programs.  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be  interactively driven through this control.  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be  added to further enhance referenced imagery.  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional  processing of remote sensed data.

Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically  and carefree.  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"HIPS----(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well  as a huge user-contributed library.  Feature description  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.  Host Configuration Requirements  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.  Availability  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts - nfotis ]  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other   palettes can be generated.Supported functions include such niceties as the following:o  image & image: + - / * interpolationo  image & constant: + - / *o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to   any specified angle.o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to   region target mean, median, or modal value.o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of   region of an image.o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot   keyword values for a set of images.o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon.

The bill would incent private companies to developlunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.There is an aggregate cap on the bids of 65 million. Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probablyworse than having the government bankroll a 65 million program, as the DeltaClipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at 59 million).

First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused aboutthis issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggestthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to RayTracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracingalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding upall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  Forexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding upand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lowerbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, youget some illumination equation like this:        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the lightintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly lesshand-waving illumination equation is this:        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by thematerial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get fromtransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for apurple-colored glass object.    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my "illuminationequation sermon" to you also.______________________________________________________________________________Steve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.hollaschkpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California
From: pstlbaurora.alaska.eduSubject: Where did the hacker ethic go?Lines: 46Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.eduOrganization: University of Alaska Fairbanks  A great many computer programmers read "Dr. Dobb's Journal".  In a recentissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  Itsaid:  "There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computerindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's."  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is somethingentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value thefree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why isit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able tohave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a personlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given anyuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completelyignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts tomake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselveshackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a factthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do sofor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in avolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smallerthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if thecorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.    That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off ofinnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaudit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreativesystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are theproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up forblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on thecomputer industry?  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+|  pstlbacad3.alaska.edu     |  "Revenge is a dish best served cold."       ||  "Szechuan Death"           |          - Khan Singh                        ||                             |            "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan"|+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

All I said was that a right is whateveryou or somebody acting for you can enforce.  The Bill of Rights didn'tcome into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly,the people); from that point it defined legal rights.

One is a C program that will perform a "morph" betweenany two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And thenit will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) outto a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functionsand insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this wouldlet me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simplyperforming incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationaryobject but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I knowan easy way around this would be to first translate the object to theorigin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was becauseI had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a newpoint and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. Howeverthis occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is appreciated.ttknockbbs.santafe.edu

I doubt that theactual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different fromSDIO's costs.Of course, this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching thegovernment procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity andinnovation with reams of documentation. ;)

I haven't actually used oneor seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to seean independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme orsomething.Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations thatrun OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They arebinary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denaliis their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field bysimply adding "transformation engines".The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstationand the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.			3400			3500CPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHzOn-chip cache		8k/8k			8k/8kOnboard cache		512K			512KWord Size		64-bit			64-bitMemory ( initial )	32-128MB		32-256MBMemory ( future )	512MB			1GBSPECMARK89		111			126SPECINT92		75			84SPECFP92		112			128GRAPHICSTransform Modules	1-6			1-6Frame Buffer Modules	5,10,20			5,10,20Frame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit			double buffered		double bufferedZ-buffer		24-bit			24-bitAlpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bitStereo support		yes			yesOther:				both machines will double buffer or do				stereo output per window.

It makes no false claims.>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making>major change to the original design.If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description ofprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTPList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:XV (shareware, 25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many otherimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with supportfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand newand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note thatversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll getonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is aglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkboxwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefullyA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS (30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, 25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, 20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry (30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, 15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, 20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, 20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware (40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, 20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, 30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-levelgrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Availablefrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers forAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about 22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.NeXT:ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some formatconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives atsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both arecurrently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specificsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around thatdoes not support JPEG.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution onesFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tglcs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.educarnegie

Orbitinsertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts thetrajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto.I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbitingmission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turnsup something really interesting.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channelof 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits torepresent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d pictureto be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previousframe) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.--Chris Lilley----------------------------------------------------------------------------Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training ProjectComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.

The question is whether: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked "Why not," I'llrespond.Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are otherfactors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature controlis difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likelyto look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layerfabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) usedtheir pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even thoughthey had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  Thespace environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due totemperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiationeffects on materials), so your "fabric" may not retain any flexibilityfor long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressurechanges in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which couldlead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposalfor an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees ofsuccess.-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office      kjenksgothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368     "Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll      work hard enough to bring them about." -- Ashleigh Brilliant

I'musing Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens betweenthe key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y andz component of the viewing direction vector of the camera whenpositioned at (x,y,z).The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with thepositions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I'vetried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to thechord between the two adjacent view points (which in general arenot key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of theviewing direction vector at the key frame positions (althoughthe spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementationerror...)Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form forsimilar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at  iharkestlise.unit.noAnyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary ofthe replies if they contact me.--  _________     __________________\\        \\  \\ \\ N G E  \\==\\ A R K E S T A D     iharkestlise.unit.no         Comp.

Morgan&Gordon's fat"Communications Satellite Handbook" has a graph of sky temperature vs.wavelength, in fact, for communications design.However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the skylooks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, "Astrophysical Quantities").I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiationtends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says "about 4K"in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.-- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer  U of Toronto Zoologybetween SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henryzoo.toronto.edu  utzoohenry

So, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume   some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation),   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic   events happening much closer to us?  The even distribution could   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays    being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-raysources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to besignificantly absorbed.

From: ldowaikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D'Oliveiro, Waikato University)Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New ZealandLines: 67OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less thanrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was aversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results(for better or for worse).I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TVa while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence wherethe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitizeda portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating spacestation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement betweenframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigotcard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I thenimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaledto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default"2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every tenframes.I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I usedfor the results I'd been reporting earlier.Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first shorttest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external harddisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback ratewas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optionalscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster whoobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 inaction, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it'sentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with"preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they playedfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback wasvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps withease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add thismuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's taskswitching.A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't seeany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slightstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between thekey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will alsoimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performanceeven more...Lawrence D'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066University of Waikato            electric mail: ldowaikato.ac.nzHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47' 26" S, 175^ 19' 7" E, GMT+12:00

In order for U.S.  industries to>compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't>has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government intothe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  Therewas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support ofstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding wasmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not thatmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers withlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds fortravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and auniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as wellas salary.During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that purescientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This isprobably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to tryto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solutionemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used todiscussion about their problems, the job got done.The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for thefuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress wasunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into thefuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedlykeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,making it more difficult for them to act to support research.The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in whichthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance ofa graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I askfor one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now themoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level itcomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member fromgetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projectsget supported, and how much.  Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So insteadof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily researchinstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came intobeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluatingreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposalhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator concealsalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I amproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrowI may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright ideawhich solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach tosomething I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, itis not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than wouldhave happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the governmentis trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.-- Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399Phone: (317)494-6054hrubinsnap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)  {purdue,pur-ee}snap.stathrubin(UUCP)

The author is not responsible for any         damage caused by this program.Important changes since Version 1.35:  Added support for IRIS.  Support Mix/Concat. two images.  Added support for 'batch conversion'.  Added support for 'load/save palette table'.  Added support for 'edge enhance'.  Added support for 'crop one line'.  Added support for 'negate image'.  New color quantization option.  Fix some minor bugs.(1) Introduction:  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different  formts.  Include simple file management system.  Support 'slide show'.+ Support 'batch conversion'.  There is NO LIMIT on image size.  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).(2) Hardware Requirement:  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.  Supported Wares:  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768  * 80387  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX  Unsupported:  * DPMI  * Microsoft Windows  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory  model, SVGA graphics.(3) Installation:  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible   with original version)  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment    GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.                 Other drivers are not tested.              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.(7) Detail:   Initialization:      Set default display type to highest display type.      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.      The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use        for reading current file.      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This        program will automatically determine which format this file is.        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check        standard extension. Still fail, report error.      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key          (except ESCAPE).        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.        ESCAPE to terminate.      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.      You can do special effect on image.      pressing RETURN: show image.        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text        mode.      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).        True Color: save as 24-bit image.        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change        directory to what you want. Then,        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                      (filename under bar).  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,     the performance is poor.  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster       (No one is better for true 24bits image)  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,     COMMENT about this program,     Please send to u7711501bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

While     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers     throughout the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory     /pub/gopher--------------------------------------------------------------------Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?A2:  You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC     or workstation     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory     /pub/gopher.

A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book"        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip      A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher".        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *      Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp".        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace      for DOS         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:       Type=1       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu       Port=70       Path=       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.      Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and     look in the gopher directory.     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine     "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize     network lag.     Telnet Public Logins:     Hostname                  IP              Login   Area     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.---------------------------------------------------------------------Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help     our campus find answers to their computer questions.       It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information     System used by a large number of sites in the world.     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to     count.      The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached     via e-mail at gopherboombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:         Internet Gopher Developers      100 Union St. SE 190      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA     Or via FAX at:       +1 (612) 625-6817---------------------------------------------------------------------Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:             - Search local WAIS indices.       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher         clients.       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher         clients.       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.-------------------------------------------------------------------Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch)     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online"     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica      is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the     gopher protocol.     To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on      Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)      Type=1      Port=70      Path=1/veronica      Host=futique.scs.unr.edu------------------------------------------------------------------------------Q8: What is Available for Biology?A8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information    availble to biologists now by gopher.Here is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search via gopher:      2.

It appears to be inducedpartly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down.     ___    _____     ___    /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalkekelvin.jpl.nasa.gov    | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

Additionally, there mightbe a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a ladenlanding.

The difference is in the directionof the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse tothe direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, theacceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In thiscase, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  The record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the directionyou're facing" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this recordwas set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.Eric Sealesealepogo.den.mmc.com

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered aFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normaltelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry intoContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetryindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineersreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modeswere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue andAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  Thesereadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AMyesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Checkfailure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will bedetermining the precise cause over the next few days.As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to InertialReference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning tocommand the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to ContingencyMode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital TapeRecorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completedyesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted FlightSequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restartC9 to complete data playback.

It was easy to imagine himtaking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the streetoutside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects ofstreetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light onlyilluminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As abonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination levelis reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby electedlocal authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerablesuccess in the desert areas around the major US observatories. Atleast, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )I suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especiallyyukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, althoughI do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.-- __._____.___._____.__._________________________________________________________|_. ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card, Joint European Torus, Abingdon    | | | |_. | |    | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK. tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404    | | |  _| | |    | email pjcjet.uk or compuserve 100010,366   ._| | | |_. | |    | It wasnt me.

Brown Associates.------Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphicssubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products usea parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Bothhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array ofpixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantlyin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and marketpenetration.There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC andE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-enddeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential andflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two tosixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends ata higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedomsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors thatsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedomdesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowingdevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purposeapplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput andvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Notethat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will notrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,however, will remain much more flexible.The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-endFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream pricepoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome becauseit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resultingin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products providestrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized thatnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali'sconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchasegeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgradethem separately as needed.Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping atworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensiveVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to providethis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolationof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higherqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denaliprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelismfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphicsdata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformationmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levelsto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linkingtexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalablesolution.Hope this helps,BrianPS This was reprinted without permission.

Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`llget round to it eventually.The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which brokethe 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leapforward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, withprimary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest oceangoing vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargoand / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rosewith the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of mileswithout coaling.Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another postersaid, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cablelaying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of layinga transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity tocarry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge fordefective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book "How the World was One"[ I think that`s right ]If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumphand a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirelyignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true theShuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are theyworth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have anaffordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended mannedmissions.

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. Thiscolour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply thesemodifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mappedto this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry toeach colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smoothcolour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending howfar each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would lookrather odd.So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file?

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.

(See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-serverrtfm.mit.edu with"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTPList FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:XV (shareware, 25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many otherimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with supportfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand newand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note thatversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll getonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is aglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkboxwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefullyA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS (30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, 25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means"pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, 20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry (30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, 15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, 20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, 20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware (40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, 20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, 30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG","VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-levelgrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Availablefrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers forAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about 22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution onesFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to"do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest commondenominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	"begin" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	"begin" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-infouunet.uu.net.-- 			tom lane			organizer, Independent JPEG GroupInternet: tglcs.cmu.edu	BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.educarnegie

The exhibition presents the untold story of the VaticanLibrary as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence ofRome as a political and scholarly superpower during theRenaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the JeffersonBuilding of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 throughApril 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available byanonymous FTP indefinitely.     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The VaticanLibrary, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Cameto Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Eachsection consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibitdirectory and contains the exhibit text for that section andseparate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibitincludes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used ifthere were a problem with one of the primary objects) and itemsomitted later in the planning process.     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissancescholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians ofscience or medicine, early music scholars, students of thehumanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, andto librarians and information professionals.

Right now she'slooking at Corel Draw and Harvard Draw. There seem to be more books in thestores on Corel than on Harvard, so she's inclined to go with Corel on thebasis of popularity. Can anyone give us an informed opinion on which package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternativeavailable?

While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out thatany significant scattering of light outside the target area for one ofthese mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would beconcerned, and something any project like that would work againstanyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there'sgoing to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too muchdark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll findmany activists in Murmansk demanding the "natural" sky back. If anything,he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the "day."The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crassadvertising.

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video standards.        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

Count rates are too low and signal rise times too longfor this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'dneed to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each ofthe detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of thedetectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one mustmodel the scattering of photons in the material around each detector,and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back ontothe spacecraft.

Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support forthe VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such asthe Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picturequality if your dithering works right).I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's toGIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGAcard and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to writesome programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and othercolour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinbergdithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palettethe resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally wouldwhen viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering butit does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my waygives a brighter more detailed image.Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, asfar as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than theVGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)Have a dayGerry.

I hear thatit is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 usefuloptions, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is thatrather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistentlyin all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers onall machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be preparedto do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be storedby pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I alsonote that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliablycompresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting thatnone of the FAX formats are really useful.What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would haveprovided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compressesbytes rather than pixels.But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can registerproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliablyread all incoming TIFF files.

Ancient astronomers observed points oflight that appeared to move among the stars. They called theseobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Romandeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love andbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. Thestargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteorsor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion werediscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun werecalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new devicecalled the telescope at the heavens and made startlingdiscoveries.     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age ofsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after WorldWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravityand travel to the Moon and to other planets.     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, thenhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automatedmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored theSun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveyswhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge andunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sightand other "senses" of our automated spacecraft, color andcomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appearedto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flightsthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkableachievements of the 20th century.     AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in manyshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate andspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instrumentsselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystemsfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as wellas for processing data and communicating with Earth.     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraftinstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arraysof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power itssolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed forbackup and supplemental power.     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyedmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near aplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instrumentspointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target To helpprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used tocontrol spacecraft.     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain aconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarersused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars tomaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked ontofixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep aspacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target bodyand the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. Thethrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speedof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered atthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched tostudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned theinner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. Thesethree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planetsbecause they share a solid-rock composition.     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASAemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called theMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of latermissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conductedthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary powersource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft hadtwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners wereequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonalbodies.     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venusspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to theMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout theprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, hadoriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. TheMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used componentsleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quitedifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solarsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers tookanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the firsthuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun'slight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelersdo not use solar power but instead operate on electricitygenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisitour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. TwinViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weatherstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landersfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrumentthat allowed it to "see" through the planet's dense cloud coverto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carriedfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes andthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during theirdescent toward the surface.     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- includingMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the CometRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is beingdeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailedexaminations that will increase our understanding of ourneighborhood and our own planet.     The Sun     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must startwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representingapproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add upto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents thematerial left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nineEarths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and itsinterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process offusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degreesCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure thereis 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun'ssurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degreesFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producingenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streamsof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion yearsand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years orso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse heliuminto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growingso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a"red giant," it will suddenly collapse into a "white dwarf" --the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillionyears to cool off completely.     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, butnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximatelytwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecrafthave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA andthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity tochange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polarregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range ofstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. Ifit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainlynever have developed on Earth.     Mercury     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was theprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched onNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After ajourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of thesolar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even thebest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinctobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to theSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet isvisible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, itis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radartelescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior tothe voyage of Mariner 10.     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed anancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our ownMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing theplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interiorcooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are ashigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310miles).     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weakmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth thedensity of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neonand helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degreesFahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surfacetemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercuryliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of aslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapidrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercurysolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the timeit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around theSun      Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock likethat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-richcore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That wouldmake Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's coreor those of any of the planets.     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made twoadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhaustedand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the samelocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet wasilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of theplanet's surface.     Venus     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetaryneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of morethan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study themysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid torest.     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the firstspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measuredVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew muchcloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5'sinstruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earthshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft werelaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the firstspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.     Five days later, the five separate components making up thesecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered theVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. Thefour small, independent probes and the main body radioedatmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward thesurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of theprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued totransmit data for another hour.     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition anddensity more closely than any other known planet. However,spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. Forexample, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the otherplanets.     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times asdense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent ofEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like agreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface buttrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back intospace. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to meltlead.     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided thefirst means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover anddetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been inorbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft usesradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution imagesof the surface.     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanicfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surfaceshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flowslying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named IshtarTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. Atone end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the sizeof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deepimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus arenamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio arethe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 millionyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably theresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonicson Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient toweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventingthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults likethe San Andreas Fault in California.     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. Atspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. Thecirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow inboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in sixalternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplifiedlaboratory for the study of our weather.     Earth     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishingcharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land massesand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consistingof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent otherconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harborlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 millionkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from theSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameterjust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core giverise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with theatmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiationcoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protectsus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they canstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left noevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soonafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with theother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris inthe early days of the solar system.     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about ourhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- waslaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, anddiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allenradiation belts, surrounding Earth.     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that ourplanet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape bythe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuouslyejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field doesnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we nowknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm anduneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day andcontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, theupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives riseto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When chargedparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magneticfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet'smagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and areknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out inspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. Thesewatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuousglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data andcontributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weathersystems.     From their unique vantage points, satellites can surveyEarth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet'shealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, providedtremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering ourplanet in dangerous ways.     The Moon     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The firsthuman footsteps on an alien world were made by Americanastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifelesscompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apolloexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor andLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materialsand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored thelunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collectionof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.     From this material and other studies, scientists haveconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon'sexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified intodifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroidsand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as RhodeIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon createdbasins hundreds of kilometers across.     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately fourbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and brokenrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began tomelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 millionyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rosefrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over thesurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areasthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,called maria, meaning seas.     As far as we can tell, there has been no significantvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only bymicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft andastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billionyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to theone today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by theApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theoriesattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separatebody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and wascaptured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of acollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.     Mars     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solarsystem's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw whatappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. Theseobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- ledto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed asystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when OrsonWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fictionclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believedin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had todo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet'ssurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions mightsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer monthsand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and oneplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensivelybefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of thesurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of theplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurringchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed adiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dryatmosphere of carbon dioxide.     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on amission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. Thespacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only tofind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that madesurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after thestorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed acrossthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off fromKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer severalquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it washoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would atleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfullytouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photossent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed ableak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by thelander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and markedby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil givesthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on UtopiaPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscapethan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visibledunes.     The results sent back by the laboratory on each VikingLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soilwere tested in three different experiments designed to detectbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed toindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that thisactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soilchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but theViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules existthere.     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording windvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature andpressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highesttemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degreesFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured atthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, butbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. VikingLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probablywater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarilycarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in smallpercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as muchwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl aroundthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morningfog can form in valleys.     There is evidence that in the past a denser martianatmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physicalfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds andislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small andirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It ispossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured tooclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large marginstheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. Thefirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating onJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shutdown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit onAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas wasused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biologyexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet exceptEarth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched inSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martianenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.      Asteroids     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallicobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to beconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known asasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in aband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some haveorbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earthhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater nearWinslow, Arizona.     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of thesolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of aplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. Morelikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into aplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids wasgathered into a single object, the object would be only about1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half thediameter of our Moon.      Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. Itis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually bephotographed through Earth-based telescopes.     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes fromexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface ofEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth arecalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere athigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter toincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If themeteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikesEarth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best placesto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed ofsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron andnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stonymeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very muchlike terrestrial rocks.     Since asteroids are material from the very early solarsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have foundthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids areseparated by very large distances.     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroidsfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA inOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way toJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassinimissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled forlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassinimissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European SpaceAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, aswell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for rawmaterials.     Jupiter     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions ofour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of fourspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of thesecolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiterwas the first port of call.     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center inMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroidbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. InDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet'sbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returnedspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellitesduring flybys in 1979.     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball ofliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmospherecomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia icecrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhapsphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues thatcharacterize Jupiter's atmosphere.     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gasesreact to form organic molecules in the regions between theplanet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lyingbelow. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, theseorganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries throughtelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter'satmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As ahigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a directionopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it issurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot andare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be amillion years old.     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upperatmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth'snorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returnedthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at adizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. Themassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journeyaround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of aminiature solar system.     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is underway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter oncepast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past twoasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe intoJupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The GalileoOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying closeto Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the twoPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.     Galilean Satellites     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter andspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the firsttime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor oftheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as theGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happilytraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographsreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past theseplanet-sized satellites.     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager missionwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a worldother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nineactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extendingas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellowhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought tothe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on thissatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by thegravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other threeGalilean moons.     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is thebrightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays acomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has beenfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europahas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is coveredby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to thecold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to itscenter.     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede andCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largestsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercuryand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water orice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of differentbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out ofthe moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on thesurface.     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has thelowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that largeamounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is themost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activityduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will beperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.     Saturn     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Itsexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn iscomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colorsand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmospherehas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are mutedby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-lookingappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocityequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100miles) per hour.     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed inNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs thatrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ringsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons inAugust 1981.     The rings are composed of countless low-density particlesorbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressivedistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio wavespassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widelyin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings arebright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing bodyventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have beentorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in itsinterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to beginwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. Athird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisionswith larger objects orbiting the planet.     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from eachother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place bythe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. Thesecomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringletsthat make up the major rings.     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AMcar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyagerspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but arebelieved to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than itsatmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had atJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras nearSaturn's poles.     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found severalsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moonsshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gapsin the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 fromimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.      Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-basedatmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's incomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars andVenus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islandsrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon'sdense clouds.     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may beconverting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- incombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The lattercompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions maybe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earthbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan'satmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permitprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassinimission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and willalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped intoTitan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use theprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and willspend years examining the Saturnian system.     Uranus     In January 1986, four and a half years after visitingSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of theUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information aboutUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned fromground observations since the planet's discovery over twocenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of thesolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception ofPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north andsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swingaround the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south polefaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when anEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of thesolar system.     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not followthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet'scenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having onemagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city ofDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and watervapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in itsatmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloudtops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind ofphotochemical "smog" believed to be a combination of acetylene,ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding theplanet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers intospace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as "electroglow."     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water anddissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representinga geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rockspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of pastactivity, including faulting and ice flows.     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surfacefeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains andwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision withanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, whichcontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragmentsfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Mirandaapparently reformed with some of the material that had been inits interior exposed on its surface.     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of brightparticles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,boulder-sized chunks.     Neptune     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar systemwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. OnAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet'satmosphere was more active than Uranus'.      Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm thesize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter'sGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moveswestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbedthe "Scooter," as well as high-altitude clouds over the mainhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of anyplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) perhour.     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogenand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's corecontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of theother gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, likeUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet'sspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon issimilar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields ofthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes theelectrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on theother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is onlyslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs ofmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear howNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept fromspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detectedthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodieswere not spotted.     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the newmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but sinceProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet'sglare for observers on Earth.      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under sixdays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowlytowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time inastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptuniangravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring toaccompany the planet's modest current rings.     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those ofIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts atSaturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed ofwater-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen andmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types ofterrain: the so-called "cantaloupe" terrain and a receding icecap.      Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are thefallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gasand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th asthick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles anddeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yetfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degreesFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any otherobject spacecraft have so far visited.     Pluto     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet theeccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it insideNeptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it willremain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than acelestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to beapproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds thesize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto'ssurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thinatmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planetmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spinaxis is tipped by 122 degrees.      The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: themoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methaneice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so bothbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto'sand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolutionare all 6.4 Earth days.      Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA iscurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.     Comets     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay avisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky andmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, cometsare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive onlyfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, aloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reachingperhaps halfway to the nearest star.     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they aregravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them closeto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outerplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made graduallywarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the innerplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itselfis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principallyof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similarto those composing the moons of the giant planets.     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a comaor cloud-like "head" that can measure tens of thousands ofkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to theSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pusheson this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and givingrise to the comet's "tails." Gases and ions are blown directlyback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles areleft behind in a curved arc.     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; ineffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) inlength, but the total amount of material contained in thisdramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --from the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentiallydramatic light shows.     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, butothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a closeencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These lattervisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly returnto the inner solar system.     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relativelyshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regularvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His namebecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the cometreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live tosee it.     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passescomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recentappearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 millionkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet wasvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southernhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been sobright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omensand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft willbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus andremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAFwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growingsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off andform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets athigh speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorerin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Sovietand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew byHalley's Comet in 1986.     Conclusion     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances ofspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past hadonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on ourneighbors in space.      We have learned more about our solar system and its membersthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automatedspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planetsbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as largeas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solarenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures ofbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes forgenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strangeand beautiful places and objects.     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solarsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology andmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline calledcomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences andsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and historyof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weathersystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and byinvestigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout thesolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions andprocesses on Earth.     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automatedspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current missionis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reachthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Futuremissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroidbelt.     We can also look forward to the time when humans will onceagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have notbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are beingformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for thehuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martianoutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at alunar base or a martian colony- end -

Look in the directory pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems forthe various volumes (Gems, GemsII, GemsIII), and get the README file first.Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available onwuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books.A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processingjournals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377cs.tut.fi.2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verboseexplanation, see any of the above references, starting with:The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes "Computer Graphics" book is certainlya good start.  Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", then read chapter 15,"Visible-Surface Determination".  For more information go to chapter 16 forshading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" byPaul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are otheralgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementationsare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note thatthe code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site,as described above.Check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated intothe xv package and described in the back of the manual.The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains anotherquantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than theother algorithms, but slower".There's also an implementation of:Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional DataClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 2 (June, 1988),pp. 153-162.avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.4) Converting color into grayscale.The NTSC formula is:    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.The only reference you need for this stuff is:    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulationsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can dosome form of gray to b&w conversion.6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the sourceimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doingsub-pixel sampling.However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originallycreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation isalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for RasterRotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaethwatcgl.waterloo.edu) GraphicsInterface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears inthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appearsin "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.7) Free image manipulation software.There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format toanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plusthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.Here are pointers to some of them:    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing    of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file    contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.    PBMPLUS, by Jef Poskanzer.  Comprehensive format conversion and image    manipulation package.  The latest version is always available via    anonymous FTP as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.Z,    wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.Z,    and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z.    IM Raster Toolkit, by Alan Paeth (awpaethwatcgl.uwaterloo.ca).    Provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit.  The    format is versatile in supporting pixels of arbitrary channels,    components, and bit precisions while allowing compression and machine    byte-order independence.  The kit contains more than 50 tools with    extensive support of image manipulation, digital halftoning and format    conversion.  Previously distributed on tape c/o the University of    Waterloo, an FTP version will appear someday.    Utah RLE Toolkit.  Conversion and manipulation package, similar to    PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*,    princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.    Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlmnl.cs.cmu.edu>.

Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <ravelingvenera.isi.edu>.  Reads and    writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some    image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP as    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, and    venera.isi.edu:pub/img_1.3.tar.Z along with a large collection of color    images.    Xim, X Image Manipulator, by Philip R. Thompson.  It does essential    interactive image manipulations and uses x11r4 and the OSF/Motif toolkit    for the interface.  It supports images in 1, 8, 24 and 32 bit formats.    Reads/writes and converts to/from GIF, xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, and    other formats.  Writes level 2 postscript.  Other utilities and image    application library are included.  Not a paint package.  Available via    ftp from gis.mit.edu.    xloadimage, by Jim Frost <maddstd.com>.  Reads in images in various    formats and displays them on an X11 screen.  Available via FTP as    export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xloadimage*, and in your nearest comp.sources.x    archive.    xli, by Grame Gill, is an updated xloadimage with numerous improvements    in both speed and in the number of formats supported.  Available in the    same places as xloadimage (contrib tape, comp.sources.x archives).    TIFF Software, by Sam Leffler <samokeeffe.berkeley.edu>.  Nice    portable library for reading and writing TIFF files, plus a few tools    for manipulating them and reading other formats.  Available via FTP as    ucbvax.berkeley.edu:pub/tiff/*.tar.Z or ftp.uu.net:graphics/tiff.tar.Z    xtiff, an X11 tool for viewing a TIFF file.  It was written to handle    as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining    simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems    with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is    distributed as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also    available on export.lcs.mit.edu, ftp.uu.net and comp.sources.x.    xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

There are a number of automated mail servers that willsend you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below fordetails on some.Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussionof software like this.  You may find useful information there.8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on freeimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages andlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter youwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of theformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp fromzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional objectformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as MarkHall <foocs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintainedby Quincey Koziol (koziolncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists atftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format mostoften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only imagesbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics andinformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.9) Converting between vector formats.A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDrawto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a verydifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Convertingone image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once youget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objectsare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filledround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to doa one-to-one conversion between vector formats.There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  Thecontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of suchconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have beenposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archivesite.A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector formatto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL toX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones forPC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs canbe used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, theanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector tovector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would betrivial.GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includesdrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used asa PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implementsessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScriptand level 2).10) How to get Pixar films.The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are availableon video tape.

That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightlymore than that normally.  (35 maybe.)  I believe it'savailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).    Pixar    1001 West Cutting Blvd.    Richmond, CA. 94804    (510) 236-4000     (510) 236-0388 (FAX)You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Red'sDream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for 25.00, plus 2.50 for shipping. Theywill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the licenseagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?The short answer is, "You can't."  Unless you use a rational spline youcan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error ofapproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were notvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want todo the job right, consult the article:  "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,  September, 1989, pages 48-56.For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:  "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]12) How to order standards documents.The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and alsoISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have thecomplete name and number.Some useful numbers to know:CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (GraphicalKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's HierarchicalInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSIY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicitcomments from the graphical public (this includes you).  ANSI can letyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineeringat 1-800-854-7179.13) How to FTP by email.There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroupsand make them available via an email query system.  You send a messageto an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail toftpmaildecwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to useit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing toinfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number ofedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interiorhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known inthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article inGlassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, includingtreatment of special cases.Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to allthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about anorder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating thetrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found inthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.15) How to tessellate a sphere.One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  Thebase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divideseach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leechcs.unc.edu>has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:Highlights of this edition-    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through       November '91;    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named"speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-             Site                             Dir	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/Eric Haines (ericheye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/globalillumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can besearched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords isincluded with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of thesites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained atprinceton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*".Tom Wilson (wilsoncs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from raytracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentiallyin plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  Thiscollection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".17) SIGGRAPH information online[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via bothanonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includesboth conference and publications subdirectories.To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to     archive-serversiggraph.organd in the subject or the body of the message include the message  sendfollowed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is withthe command     send indexwhich will give you an up-to-date list of available information.18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedingsat the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are availablein three formats:     text   (ASCII)     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:(1) by anonymous ftp    change to one of the directories       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary     mode.    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the    contents of each panel file.(2) by electronic mail    send mail to       archive-serversiggraph.org    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages       send panel91-txt index       send panel91-rtf index    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.19) Graphics mailing listsThere are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, eachcovering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been anactive participant in one of these for some time now, and find thefocus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topicto be nothing short of amazing.Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others youwould like to see added.Name:		Imagine mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Imagine 3D Rendering and		Animation package by Impulse, Inc.Platforms:	Amiga, IBMSubscription:	imagine-requestemail.sp.paramax.comPosting:	imagineemail.sp.paramax.comName:		DCTV mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Digital Creations DCTV		box, software, and file formatsPlatforms:	AmigaSubscription:	DCTV-requestnova.cc.purdue.eduPosting:	DCTVnova.cc.purdue.eduName:		Rayshade Users mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of the Rayshade raytracerPlatforms:	Most UNIX boxes, Amiga, Mac, IBMSubscription:	rayshade-requestcs.princeton.eduPosting:	rayshade-userscs.princeton.eduName:		Lightwave 3D software for Toaster mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for users of Lightwave, the Video		Toaster modelling and rendering packagePlatforms:	AmigaSubscription:	lightwave-requestbobsbox.rent.com		with "subscribe lightwave-l" in your messagePosting:	lightwavebobsbox.rent.comName:		POV mailing listDescription:	Discussion forum for DKBTrace and POV renderersPlatforms:	UnixSubscription:	listservtrearn.bitnetPosting:	dkb-ltrearn.bitnetName:		Mailing List For Massive Parallel RenderingDescription:	same?Platforms:	UnixSubscription:	mp-render-requesticase.eduPosting:	mp-rendericase.edu20) Specific references on file formats    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 36.95 hardcover,      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 24.95 paper.

It is quite limited in some ways (yes, thekeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't likeit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Questionwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a listof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General infoSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific infoNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answersAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp frompit-manager.mit.edu in the files:/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2Also available from mail-serverpit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mailmessage containing any or all of:send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2Send a message containing "help" to get general information about themail server.Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and20 above for more information.22) What is morphing?Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a newlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping andmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.auin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer anduncompress them afterwards.23) How to ray-trace height fieldsHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, theyget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt belocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:F.

Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sellwere bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buya good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have toeither order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At somepoint, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force codedown the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latteris more likely to work.>>Please note that I'm not defending light pollution.

From: svec5menudo.uh.edu (T.C. Zhao)Subject: Full Color Image Editor for SGI WorkstationsOrganization: University of HoustonLines: 159Distribution: worldNNTP-Posting-Host: menudo.uh.edu   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.   The following is the relevant sections from the man page.    -----------------------------------------------------------------Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)NAME   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI WorkstationsDESCRIPTION  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically  giving great flexibility in processing an image.FEATURES  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,   the processed image will be displayed.  Current features include  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing    and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with    the option of subpixel sampling.  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as    in TeX(1), e.g., \alpha\small\beta produces Greek alphabet alpha    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-    lability of graphical histograms of the image.  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a    circle).  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.  o Performs histogram equalization.  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of    arbitrary order.  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.  o Cuts and pastes across images.  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause    interval between images. (SlideShow)  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.  o Performs image type conversions.  o Converts image formats.  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image    back and display it.  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the    resulting power spectra.  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release). SUPPORTED FORMATS      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS      o  JPEG(JFIF) format      o  CompuServ GIF      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)      o  TIFF      o  PostScript(Write only)Hardware requirements:---------------------------------------------------------------   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.Where to get it:---------------------------------------------------------------   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z   where xxx is the version number.

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want toanswer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What thesepeople are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful objectoriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented onboth Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programmingapproach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the softwaredevelopment time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program isnot dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability.Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a greatidea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak onthe Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulationstudies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  Thereare tons of applications, with the ability to create "virtual" instrumentsthat can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With theaddition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serialI/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control softwarefor the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.Dennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville

Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think itwas Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato."If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advancesin human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since hisideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtfulthat his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 yearsfrom now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the mostinfluential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone whocame after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and amplified them over time).I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have tobe Dewey.But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respectwas "American", but was born in Russia).

Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'mguessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairlysure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s whiledisplaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

It may feel strange at first,: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that: of sky diving.I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'lltell you about my first flight.At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spinestraightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grabonto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling myinvoluntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I couldfeel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed whileyou have a cold).At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experimentgoing and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" ofgravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really payattention to physiology at that time.After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing oneof the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motionsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out toparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and Ihad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basicallyuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats inthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for justthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalouspeople who don't get sick on the thing.)I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" somuch as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensationsI feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.Jerry:: >And what is the motion sickness: >that some astronauts occasionally experience?

From: abignetcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp)Subject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest)Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)Lines: 92	Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 	Contest Announcement)WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts Plug and Play on every PC.The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-platform use of the same device.ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:=====================================ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty.ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.ACCESS.bus Physical Layer^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware protocol, with one data line and one clock line.Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization.  ACCESS.bus Software Protocols^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the receiver.  BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with additional semantics, including checksum.Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running, without rebooting.APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: keyboards, locators, and text devices.ACCESS.bus support on the PC^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers.To Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):------------------------------------------------Postal Address:370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086Internet Email:  abignetcom.comFax: (408) 991-3773Voice: (408) 991-3517

There is no evidence thatsigns of life found in old rock predate putative planet-sterilizingevents.  Rather, the argument was that if life arose shortly the laststerilizing event, then it must be easily formed.  The *inference*was that life originated before and was destroyed, but there wasno evidence of that.However, even this argument is flawed.  It could well be that origin oflife requires specific conditions (say, a certain composition of theatmosphere) that do not last for long.  So, perhaps life formedearly only because it would have had no other chance to do so,not because it was likely that life would originate under thoseconditions.	Paul F. Dietz	dietzcs.rochester.edu
